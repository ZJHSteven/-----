Digestive system
Anatomy and Physiology of the Digestive System
Fig.7.1 anatomy of digestive system
The digestive system has three main functions: digesting food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating wastes. Digestion is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food
into forms that cell membranes can absorb. Mechanical digestion breaks large pieces
into smaller ones without altering their chemical composition. Chemical digestion
breaks food into simpler nutrient molecules like glucose, triglycerides and amino acid. These simpler nutrient molecules are absorbed from the intestines and circulated
throughout the body by the cardiovascular system. They are used for growth and repair
of organs and tissues. Any food that cannot be digested or absorbed becomes a waste
product and is expelled. The organs of digestive system are traditionally separated into two major groups:
the alimentary canal, or gastrointestinal(GI) tract ， and the accessory digestive
organs. The alimentary canal is approximately 9 meters long in a cadaver but is
considerably shorter in a living person. It consists of the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, 1
stomach, and small and large intestines(or colon), rectum, and anus. The accessory
structures include the salivary glands, gallbladder, liver, and pancreas, each of which
is connected to the alimentary canal by a duct, and secrete its products into the
alimentary canal. Oral cavity
Fig.7.2 anatomy of oral cavity
The digestive system begins when food enters the mouth and is mechanically
broken up by the chewing movement of the teeth. The tongue, with its muscular action, moves the food within the mouth and mixes it with saliva. Saliva contains digestive
enzymes that break down carbohydrates and lubricants that make it easier to swallow
the food. Taste buds are found on the surface of the tongue and can distinguish the
bitter, sweet, sour and salty flavors in our food. The roof of the oral cavity is known as
the palate. The roof of the mouth consists of the hard palate, the bony anterior portion, and the soft palate, the flexible posterior portion. Hanging down from the posterior edge
of the soft palate is the uvula. The uvula serves two important functions. It helps in the
production of speech and is the location of gag reflex. The gag reflex helps prevent us
from accidentally inhaling food or liquids without first swallowing. The cheeks form the
lateral walls of this cavity and the lips are the anterior opening. The entire oral cavity is
lined with mucous membrane. Teeth
Teeth are important for the first stage of digestion. The teeth in the front of the
mouth bite, tear, or cut food into small pieces. These cutting teeth include the incisors, and the cuspids, or canines. The remaining teeth grind and crush food into even finer
pieces. These grinding teeth include the bicuspids or premolars and the molars. A
tooth can be subdivided into the crown and root. The crown is the part of the tooth
above the gum line. The root is below the gum line and anchors the tooth in the jaw
bone. The crown of the tooth is covered by a layer of enamel, the hardest substance in
the body. Under the enamel is dentin, which makes the main bulk of the tooth. The
2
hollow interior of a tooth is the pulp cavity in the crown and root canal in the root. These cavities contain soft tissue made up of blood vessels, nerves and lymph vessels.
Figure 7.3 set of baby teeth and set of permanent teeth
Humans have two sets of teeth. The first sets, often called baby teeth, or milk
teeth, are the deciduous teeth. There are 20 teeth in this set erupt through the gums
between ages of 6 to 28 months. At approximately 6 years of age, these teeth begin to
fall out and are replaced by the 32 permanent teeth. This replacement process will
continue until about 18 to 20 years of age. Pharynx
After food has left the mouth, it enters the oropharynx and then the
laryngopharynx. The epiglottis covers the larynx and trachea so that food is shunted
away from the lungs and into esophagus. Esophagus
The esophagus is a muscular tube that is about 10 inches long in adults. Food
entering the esophagus from the pharynx is delivered to the stomach. The food is
propelled along the esophagus by wave-like muscular movement called peristalsis. In
fact, peristalsis will work to push food through the entire gut tube. Stomach
The stomach is on the left side of the abdominal cavity and is hidden by the liver
and diaphragm. This J-shaped muscular organ acts as a bag or sac to collect, churn, digest and store food. There are four main regions in the stomach: the cardiac
region(the area surrounding the cardiac orifice through which food enters the stomach
from the esophagus), the fundus (the expanded portion of the stomach, superolateral to
3
4
the cardiac region), the body or main portion (midportion of the stomach, inferior to the
fundus), and the funnel-shaped pyloric region(consisting of the superior-most pyloric
antrum, the more narrow pyloric canal, the terminal pyloris, which is continuous with
the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter).
The folds in the lining of the stomach are called rugae. When the stomach is filled
with food, the rugae are stretched out and disappear. Hydrochloric acid is secreted by
glands in the mucous membrane lining of the stomach. Food mixes with HC1 and other
gastric juices to form a
liquid mixture called
chyme, which then passes
through the remaining
portion of the digestive
system. The stomach contains
muscular valves called
sphincters, that control
the flow of food in one
direction only. The cardiac
sphincter, named after its
location near the heart, is
located between the
esophagus and fundus. It
is also called the lower
esophageal sphincter. It
keeps food from backing
up into the esophagus. The pyloric sphincter opens and closes to control the passage of
food into the small intestines with each opening of sphincter for two important reasons:
first, the small intestines are much narrower than the stomach and cannot hold as much
as the stomach can. Second, the chyme is highly acidic and must be thoroughly
neutralized as it leaves the stomach. Small intestine
Fig.7.4 anatomy of stomach 1
Fig.7.5 anatomy of stomach 2
5
The small intestine is a convoluted tube, 6 to 7 meters (about 20 feet) long in a
cadaver but only about 2 meters long during life because of muscle tone. It is located
between the pyloric sphincter and colon. The small intestine has three sections: the duodenum, the jejunum, and ileum. (1)
The duodenum, which extends from the pyloric sphincter to the jejunum, is about
25cm (10 inches) long, and curves around the head of the pancreas. Digestion is
completed in the duodenum after partly digested chyme from the stomach is mixed with
digestive juices from the pancreas and gallbladder. (2) The jejunum, or middle portion, extends from the middle of the small intestine to the ileum and is about 2.5 m (8 feet)
long. Most of the jejunum occupies the umbilical region of the abdominal cavity. (3)
The ileum is the last portion of small intestine and extends from the jejunum to the
colon. At 3.6m (12 feet) in length, it is the longest portion of small intestine. The ileum
connects to the colon through a sphincter called the ileocecal valve. The small intestine
is the major site of digestion and absorption of nutrients from food. Because the small
intestine is concerned with absorption of food products, an abnormality in this organ can
cause malnutrition. Each component of the small intestines has different functions it
needs to attend to. For example:
The duodenum absorbs iron (Fe). The jejunum absorbs most of the nutrients. The terminal or ending part of the ileum absorbs vitamin B12and bile salts.
Fig.7.6 anatomy of small intestine
Fig.7.7 structure of villi
Small intestinal lining is made up of
small structure like hair called Villi. Intestinal villi are fingerlike extensions of
intestinal mucosa which project into the
lumen of the small intestine.The small
intestine is the major site of digestion and
absorption of nutrients from food. Because
the small intestine is concerned with
absorption of food products, an
abnormality in this organ can cause
malnutrition.
6
Colon
Fluid that remains after the complete digestion and absorption of nutrients in the
small intestine enters the colon or large intestine. Most of this fluid is water and it is
reabsorbed into the body. The material that remains after absorption is solid waste called
feces. This is the product evacuated in bowel movements. The colon is approximately 5 feet long and extends from the ileocecal valve of the
small intestine to the anus. The cecum is a pouch or sac-like area in the first 2-3 inches
at the beginning of the colon. The appendix is a small worm-shaped outgrowth at the
end of the cecum. The remaining colon consists of the ascending colon, transverse
colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon. The ascending colon on the right side
extends from the cecum to
Accessory organs of digestive system
The accessory organs of the digestive system, the salivary glands, the liver, the
pancreas, and gallbladder, generally function by producing much of the digestive
fluids and enzymes necessary for the chemical breakdown of food. Each is attached to
the gut by a duct. Salivary gland
Food in the mouth and mechanical pressure (even chewing rubber bands or wax)
stimulate the salivary glands to secrete saliva. This very watery and slick fluid allows
food to be swallowed with less danger of choking. Saliva mixed with food in the mouth
forms a bolus, which is then ready to be swallowed. Saliva also contains the digestive
enzyme amylase that begins the digestion of carbohydrates. There are three pairs of salivary glands. The parotid glands are in front of the ears. The submandibular glands and sublingual glands are in the floor of the mouth.
the lower border of the liver. The
transverse colon begins where the
ascending leaves off and moves
horizontally across the upper
abdomen toward spleen. The
descending colon then travels down
the left side of the body to where the
sigmoid colon begins. The sigmoid
colon leads into the rectum. The
rectum is the area for storage of
feces. The rectum leads into the anus, which contains the anal sphincter. This sphincter is controlled by
muscles that assist in the evacuation
of feces or defecation. Fig.7.8 structure of colon
7
Liver and Gallbladder
The human liver is one of the body’s most important organs, and performs many
metabolic functions. However, its digestive function is to produce bile, which leaves the
liver through the common hepatic duct and then enters the duodenum through the bile
duct. Bile has no enzymatic action but emulsifies fats. Emulsification means the
process of breaking up large fat particles into smaller ones and making them more
soluble in the watery environment inside the intestines. When digestive activity is not occurring in the digestive tract, bile backs up the
cystic duct, and enters the gallbladder, a small, green sac on the inferior surface of the
liver. It is stored there until needed for digestive process. While in the gallbladder, bile
is concentrated by the removal of water and some ions. When fat-rich food enters the
duodenum, a hormonal stimulus causes the gallbladder to contract, releasing the stored
bile and making it available to the duodenum. If bile contains an excessive amount of cholesterol and other secretions, it
compacts into gallstones. There is a higher incidence of stone formation in women than
in men, with obesity increasing the risk. If the common hepatic or bile duct is blocked, bile is prevented from entering the small intestine, accumulates, and eventually backs up
into the liver. This exerts pressure on the liver cells, and bile begins to enter the
bloodstream. As the bile circulates through the body, the tissue become yellow or
jaundiced. Blockage is just one cause of jaundice. More often it results from actual
liver problems such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, a condition in which the liver is severely
damaged and becomes hard and fibrous. Besides the digestive functions, the liver is very important in the initial processing
of nutrient-rich blood draining the digestive organs. And much of the glucose
transported to the liver from the digestive system is stored as glycogen in liver for later
use, and amino acids are taken from the blood by the liver cells and utilized to make
Fig.7.8 structure of biliary system
The liver, the
largest gland in the body, is located inferior to the
diaphragm, more to the
right than the left side of
the body. It hides the
stomach from the view in
a superficial observation
of the abdominal
contents. The human
liver has four lobes, and
is suspended from the
diaphragm and anterior
abdominal wall by the
falciform ligament.

plasma proteins. Pancreas
The pancreas is a soft, triangular gland that extends horizontally across the
posterior abdominal wall from the spleen to the duodenum. The pancreas produces a
whole spectrum of hydrolytic enzymes, which it secretes in an alkaline fluid into the
duodenum through the pancreatic duct. Pancreatic juice is very alkaline. It neutralizes
the acidic chyme entering the duodenum from the stomach, enabling the pancreatic and
intestinal enzymes to operate at their optimal PH. The pancreas is also an endocrine
gland. It produces the hormones insulin and glucagon, which play a role in regulating
the level of glucose in the blood. Combining forms relating to the digestive system

Abdominal ultrasonography Using ultrasound equipment for producing sound
waves to create an image of the abdominal organs. Barium enema Radiographic examination of the small intestine, large
intestine, or colon in which an enema containing
barium(Ba) is administered to the patient while X-ray
pictures are taken. Also called a lower GI series. Barium swallow A barium(Ba) mixture swallowed while X-ray pictures
are taken of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum;
used to visualize the upper GI. Also called upper GI
series. Gastroscopy A flexible gastroscope is passed through the mouth
and down the esophagus in order to visualize inside
the mouth. Used to diagnose peptic ulcers and gastric
carcinoma. Liver biopsy Excision of a small piece of liver tissue for
microscopic examination. Generally used to determine
if cancer is present. Stool culture A laboratory test of feces to determine if any
pathogenic bacteria are present. Upper GI series Administering a barium contrast material orally and
then taking an X-ray to visualize the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Also called barium swallow. Pathology Relating to the Digestive System
1. Gastric cancer
Gastric cancer can develop in any part of the stomach and may spread throughout
the stomach and to other organs; particularly the esophagus, lungs and the liver. Stomach cancer causes nearly one million deaths worldwide per year. Stomach cancer is
the fourth most common cancer worldwide with 930,000 cases diagnosed in 2002. It is
10
a disease with a high death rate (700,000 per year) making it the second most common
cause of cancer death worldwide after lung cancer. It is more common in men. Etiology
It is suspected several risk factors are involved including diet, gastritis, intestinal
metaplasia and Helicobacter pylori infection. It is associated with high salt in the diet, smoking, and low intake of fruits and vegetables. Infection with the bacterium H. pylori
is the main risk factor in about 80% or more of gastric cancers. A Korean diet, high in
salted, stewed and broiled foods, is thought to be a contributing factor. Ten percent of
cases show a genetic component. Gastric cancer shows a male predominance in its
incidence as up to 3 males are affected for every female. Estrogen may protect women
against the development of this cancer form. Symptoms
Stomach cancer is often asymptomatic or causes only nonspecific symptoms in its
early stages. By the time symptoms occur, the cancer has generally metastasized to
other parts of the body, one of the main reasons for its poor prognosis. Stomach cancer
can cause the following signs and symptoms:
Early
 Indigestion or a burning sensation (heartburn)
 Loss of appetite, especially for meat
Late
 Abdominal pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen
 Nausea and vomiting
 Diarrhea or constipation
 Bloating of the stomach after meals
 Weight loss
 Weakness and fatigue
 Bleeding (vomiting blood or having blood in the stool), which can lead to anemia
 Dysphagia; this feature suggests a tumor in the cardia or extension of the gastric
tumor in to the esophagus. These can be symptoms of other problems such as a stomach virus, gastric ulcer
and diagnosis should be done by a gastroenterologist or an oncologist. Diagnosis
To find the cause of symptoms, the doctor asks about the patient's medical history, does a physical exam, and may order laboratory studies. The patient may also have one
or all of the following exams:
Gastroscopic exam is the diagnostic method of choice. This involves insertion of a
fibre optic camera into the stomach to visualize it. Upper GI series (may be called barium roentgenogram)
Computed tomography or CT scanning of the abdomen may reveal gastric cancer, but is more useful to determine invasion into adjacent tissues, or the presence of spread
to local lymph nodes. Abnormal tissue seen in a gastroscope examination will be biopsied by the surgeon
or gastroenterologist. This tissue is then sent to a pathologist for histological
examination under a microscope to check for the presence of cancerous cells. A biopsy, with subsequent histological analysis, is the only sure way to confirm the presence of
cancer cells. Treatment
Like any cancer, treatment is adapted to fit each person's individual needs and
depends on the size, location, and extent of the tumor, the stage of the disease, and
general health. Cancer of the stomach is difficult to cure unless it is found in an early
stage (before it has begun to spread). Unfortunately, because early stomach cancer
causes few symptoms, the disease is usually advanced when the diagnosis is made. Treatment for stomach cancer may include surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation
therapy. New treatment approaches such as biological therapy and improved ways of
using current methods are being studied in clinical trials. Surgery
Surgery is the most common treatment for stomach cancer. The surgeon removes
part or all of the stomach, as well as some of the tissue around the stomach, with the
basic goal of removing all cancer and a margin of normal tissue. Depending on the
extent of invasion and the location of the tumor, surgery may also include removal of
part of the intestine or pancreas. Endoscopic mucosal resection is a treatment for early
gastric cancer that has been pioneered in Japan, but is available in the United States at
some centers. In this procedure, the tumor is removed from the wall of the stomach
using an endoscope, with the advantage in that it is a smaller operation than removing
the stomach. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a similar technique pioneered
in Japan, used to resect large sections of mucosa in a successful attempt to decrease
gastric cancer recurrence. Chemotherapy
The use of chemotherapy to treat stomach cancer has no established standard of
care. Scientists are exploring the benefits of giving chemotherapy before surgery to
shrink the tumor, or as adjuvant therapy after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells. Combination treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy is also under study. Doctors are testing a treatment in which anticancer drugs are put directly into the
abdomen (intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion). Chemotherapy also is being
studied as a treatment for cancer that has spread, and as a way to relieve symptoms of
the disease. The side effects of chemotherapy depend mainly on the drugs the patient
receives. Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) is the use of high-energy rays to
damage cancer cells and stop them from growing. When used, it is generally in
combination with surgery and chemotherapy, or used only with chemotherapy in cases
where the individual is unable to undergo surgery. Radiation therapy may be used to
relieve pain or blockage by shrinking the tumor for palliation of incurable disease
2.Peptic ulcer disease
A peptic ulcer, also known as ulcus pepticum, PUD(peptic ulcer disease), is an
ulcer (defined as mucosal erosions equal to or greater than 0.5 cm) of an area of the
gastrointestinal tract that is usually acidic and thus extremely painful. As much as 80%
11
12
of ulcers are associated with Helicobacter pylori, a spiral-shaped bacterium that lives in
the acidic environment of the stomach, however only 20% of those cases go to a doctor. Ulcers can also be caused or worsened by drugs such as aspirin and other
NSAIDs(non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs). Contrary to general belief, more peptic
ulcers arise in the duodenum (first part of the small intestine, just after the stomach)
than in the stomach. About 4% of stomach ulcers are caused by a malignant tumor, so
multiple biopsies are needed to make sure. Duodenal ulcers are generally benign. Classification
A peptic ulcer may arise at various locations:
 Stomach (called gastric ulcer)
 Duodenum (called duodenal ulcer)
 Esophagus (called esophageal ulcer)
Types of peptic ulcers:
 Type I: Ulcer along the lesser curve of stomach
 Type II: Two ulcers present - one gastric, one duodenal
 Type III: Prepyloric ulcer
 Type IV: Proximal gastresophageal ulcer
 Type V: Anywhere along gastric body, NSAID(non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs)
induced
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of a peptic ulcer can be abdominal pain, classically epigastric with
severity relating to mealtimes, after around 3 hours of taking a meal (duodenal ulcers
are classically relieved by food, while gastric ulcers are exacerbated by it);
 bloating and abdominal fullness;
 waterbrash (rush of saliva after an episode of regurgitation to dilute the acid in
esophagus);
 nausea, and lots of vomiting;
 loss of appetite and weight loss;
 hematemesis (vomiting of blood); this can occur due to bleeding directly from a
gastric ulcer, or from damage to the esophagus from severe/continuing vomiting.  melena (tarry, foul-smelling feces due to oxidized iron from hemoglobin);
rarely, an ulcer can lead to a gastric or duodenal perforation. This is extremely
painful and requires immediate surgery. A history of heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and use of certain
forms of medication can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with
peptic ulcer include NSAID (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) and most
glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone and prednisolone). The timing of the symptoms in relation to the meal may differentiate between
gastric and duodenal ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give epigastric pain during the meal, as gastric acid is secreted, or after the meal, as the alkaline duodenal contents reflux into
the stomach. Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would manifest mostly before the meal—
when acid (production stimulated by hunger) is passed into the duodenum. However, this is not a reliable sign in clinical practice. Complications
 Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common complication. Sudden large
bleeding can be life-threatening. It occurs when the ulcer erodes one of the blood
vessels.  Perforation (a hole in the wall) often leads to catastrophic consequences. Erosion of
the gastro-intestinal wall by the ulcer leads to spillage of stomach or intestinal
content into the abdominal cavity. Perforation at the anterior surface of the stomach
to acute peritonitis, initially chemical and later bacterial peritonitis. The first sign is
often sudden intense abdominal pain. Posterior wall perforation leads to pancreatitis;
pain in this situation often radiates to the back.  Penetration is when the ulcer continues into adjacent organs such as the liver and
pancreas.  Scarring and swelling due to ulcers causes narrowing in the duodenum and gastric
outlet obstruction. Patient often presents with severe vomiting.  Pyloric stenosis
Stress and ulcers
Despite the finding that a bacterial infection is the cause of ulcers in 80% of cases, bacterial infection does not appear to explain all ulcers and researchers continue to look
at stress as a possible cause, or at least a complication in the development of ulcers. An expert panel convened by the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research
concluded that ulcers are not purely an infectious disease and that psychological factors
do play a significant role. Researchers are examining how stress might promote H. pylori infection. For example, Helicobacter pylori thrives in an acidic environment, and
stress has been demonstrated to cause the production of excess stomach acid. A study of peptic ulcer patients in a Thai hospital showed that chronic stress was
strongly associated with an increased risk of peptic ulcer, and a combination of chronic
stress and irregular mealtimes was a significant risk factor. Diagnosis
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), a form of endoscopy, also known as
a gastroscopy, is carried out on patients in whom a peptic ulcer is suspected. By direct
visual identification, the location and severity of an ulcer can be described. Moreover, if
no ulcer is present, EGD can often provide an alternative diagnosis. The diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori can be made by:
 Urea breath test (noninvasive and does not require EGD);
 Direct culture from an EGD biopsy specimen; this is difficult to do, and can be
expensive. Most labs are not set up to perform H. pylori cultures;
 Direct detection of urease activity in a biopsy specimen by rapid urease test;
 Measurement of antibody levels in blood (does not require EGD). It is still
somewhat controversial whether a positive antibody without EGD is enough to
warrant eradication therapy;
 Stool antigen test;
 Histological examination and staining of an EGD biopsy. Treatment
Younger patients with ulcer-like symptoms are often treated with antacids or H2
antagonists before EGD is undertaken. Bismuth compounds may actually reduce or
even clear organisms, though it should be noted that the warning labels of some bismuth
subsalicylate products indicate that the product should not be used by someone with an
13
14
ulcer.Patients who are taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) may also be
prescribed a prostaglandin analogue (Misoprostol) in order to help prevent peptic ulcers, which may be a side-effect of the NSAIDs. When H. pylori infection is present, the most effective treatments are combinations
of 2 antibiotics (e.g. Clarithromycin, Amoxicillin, Tetracycline, Metronidazole) and 1
proton pump inhibitor (PPI), sometimes together with a bismuth compound. In
complicated, treatment-resistant cases, 3 antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin + clarithromycin +
metronidazole) may be used together. An effective first-line therapy for uncomplicated
cases would be Amoxicillin + Metronidazole + Rabeprazole (a PPI). In the absence of H. pylori, long-term higher dose PPIs are often used. Treatment of H. pylori usually leads to clearing of infection, relief of symptoms
and eventual healing of ulcers. Recurrence of infection can occur and retreatment may
be required, if necessary with other antibiotics. Since the widespread use of PPI's in the
1990s, surgical procedures (like "highly selective vagotomy") for uncomplicated peptic
ulcers became obsolete. Perforated peptic ulcer is a surgical emergency and requires surgical repair of the
perforation. Most bleeding ulcers require endoscopy urgently to stop bleeding with
cautery or injection. Word List

IV. Case study
Reason for consultation: evaluation of recurrent epigastric and LUQ pain with anemia. History of present illness: patient is a 56-year-old male. He reports a long history of
mild dyspepsia characterized by burning epigastric pain, especially when his stomach is
empty. This pain has been relieved by over-the counter antiacids. Approximately 2
weeks ago, the pain became significantly worse and he is also nauseated and has
vomited several times. Past medical history: patient’s history is not significant for other digestive system
disorders. He had a tonsillectomy at age 8. He sustained a compound fracture of the left
ankle in a bicycle accident at age 11 that required surgical fixation. More recently he has
been disgnosed with an enlarged prostate glands and surgery has been recommended. However, he would like to resolve this epigastric pain before going forward with the
TUR. Results of physical examination: CBC indicates anemia and an occult blood test is
positive for blood in the feces. A blood test for helicobacter pylori is positive. An
erosion in the grastric line was visualized on an upper GI. Follow-up gastroscopy found
evidence of mild reflux esophagitis and an ulcerated lesion in the lining of the pyloric
section of the stomach. This ulcer is 1.5 cm in diameter and deep. There is evidence of
active bleeding from the ulcer. Multiple biopsies were taken and they were negative for
gastric cancer. IV tagment relieved the painful symptoms in 2 days. Assessment: peptic ulcer. Gastric cancer has been ruled out in light of the negative
biopsies. Recommendations: a gastrectomy to remove the ulcerated portion of stomach is
indicated because ulcer is already bleeding. Patient should continue on Tagment to
reduce stomach acid. Two medications will be added: keflex to treat the bacterial
infection and iron pills to reverse the anemia. Patient was instructed to eat frequent
small meals and avoid alcohol and irritating food. Critical thinking questions:
1. This patient reports LUQ pain. What does LUQ stand for and what organs do you
find there?
2. This patient had two diagnostic tests that indicated he was losing blood. Name these
two tests and then describe them in your own words. 3. This patient had a procedure to visually examine the ulcer. Name the procedure and

Urinary System
Anatomy and Physiology of the Urinary System
The urinary system is one of the hardest working systems of the body. All the
body’s metabolic processes result in the production of waste products. These waste
products are a natural part of all life but quickly become toxic if they stay in the body, resulting in a condition called Uremia. The main function of the urinary system is to
filter and remove waste products from the blood. These waste materials result in the
production and excretion of urine from the body. The major organs of the urinary
system are a pair of kidneys, which regulate the volume, composition, and pH of body
fluids; a pair of tubular ureters, which transport urine from the kidneys; a saclike
urinary bladder, which is a urine reservoir; and a tubular urethra, which conveys
urine to the outside of the body. The actual filtration or sifting of the waste products
takes place in millions of nephrons, which make up each of the two kidneys. Kidneys are responsible for homeostasis or balance in your body. They continually
adjust the chemical conditions in the body that allow you to survive. Because of its
interaction with the bloodstream and its ability to excrete substances from the body, the
urinary system maintains the proper balance of water and chemicals in the body.
Kidneys
The two kidneys are located behind the abdominal cavity (retroperitoneal) on
either side of the vertebral column in the lumbar region of the spine. They are reddish
If the body is low on water, the
kidneys conserve it, or in the opposite
case, if there is excess water in the body, the kidneys excrete the excess. In
addition to water, the kidneys regulate the
level of electrolytes—small biologically
important molecules such as sodium
(Na
+
), potassium (K+
), chloride (Cl–), and bicarbonate (HCO3
–). Finally, the
kidneys play an important role in
maintaining the correct pH range within
the body, making sure we do not become
too acidic or too alkaline. Fig.8.1 Components of the urinary system
brown, bean-shaped organs with a smooth surface. The concave area in the center is
called the hilum, where the renal artery that carries the blood full of waste products
enters the kidney and the renal vein that returns the cleansed blood to the general
circulation leaves it. The ureters also leave the kidneys at the hilum. The kidneys are embedded in a cushion of adipose tissue and surrounded by
fibrous connective tissue for protection. They are fist-sized and weigh about 4 to 6
ounces each. The kidneys consist of an outer cortex region and an inner medulla region. Within
the medulla are a dozen or so triangular-shaped areas, the renal pyramids. The tip of
each pyramid points inward toward the hilum. At its tip, called the renal papilla, each
pyramid opens into a calyx (pl. calyces), which is continuous with the renal pelvis. The
calyces and ultimately the renal pelvis collect urine as it is formed. The ureter for each
kidney is attached to the renal pelvis.
Fig.8.2 Right kidney, coronal section
Nephrons
The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney. A kidney contains about one
million nephrons, each consisting of a renal corpuscle and a renal tubule. The renal
corpuscle is the blood-filtering portion of the nephron. It is composed of a filtering unit
consisting of a tangled cluster of blood capillaries called a glomerulus and a
surrounding thin-walled saclike structure called a glomerular or Bowman’s capsule. An afferent arteriole carries blood to the glomerulus, and an efferent arteriole carries
blood away from the glomerulus. The renal tubule leads away from the glomerular capsule and becomes highly
coiled. This coiled portion of the tubule is named the proximal convoluted tubule. 20
Following the proximal convoluted tubule is a structure known as the loop of Henle or
nephron loop. The proximal convoluted tubule dips toward the renal pelvis to become
the descending limb of the nephron loop. The tubule then curves back toward its renal
corpuscle and forms the ascending limb of the nephron loop. The ascending limb
returns to the region of the renal corpuscle. Where it becomes highly coiled again and is
called the distal convoluted tubule. This distal portion tends to be shorter and less
convoluted than the proximal tubule. Several distal convoluted tubules merge in the
renal cortex to form a collecting tubule, which, in turn, passes into the renal medulla, becoming larger and larger in diameter as it joins other collecting tubules. The resulting
tube empties into a minor calyx through an opening in a renal papilla. Water and
substances that were removed from the bloodstream in the renal corpuscle flow into the
renal tubules to finish the urine production process.
Fig.8.3 structure of nephron
Urine formation
The main function of the nephrons is to control the composition of body fluids and
remove wastes from the blood. The end product is urine, which is excreted from the
body. It contains wastes, excess water and electrolytes. Urine formation involves three processes: filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. Each of these steps is performed by a different section of the nephrons. 1. Filtration. The first stage is the filtering of particles, which occurs in the renal
corpuscle. The pressure of blood flowing through the glomerulus forces material
through the glomerular wall of Bowman’s/ glomerular capsule into the renal
tubules. This fluid in the tubules is called the glomerular filtrate and consists of
water, electrolytes, nutrients such as glucose and amino acids, wastes, and
toxins. 2. Reabsorption. After filtration, the filtrate passes through the four sections of the
tubule. As the filtrate moves along its twisted journey, most of the water and much
of the electrolytes and nutrients are reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries, a
21
capillary bed that surrounds the renal tubules. They can then reenter the
circulating blood. 3. Secretion. The final stage of urine production occurs when the special cells of the
renal tubules secrete ammonia, uric acid, and other waste substances directly into
the renal tubule. Urine formation is now finished; it passes into the collecting
tubules, renal papilla, calyx, and ultimately into the renal pelvis.
Fig.8.4 Urine formation
Ureters
Ureters are the narrow muscular tubes lined with mucous membrane. Each ureter is
about 25 centimeters long, from the renal pelvis to the urinary bladder. It extends
downward behind the parietal peritoneum and parallel to the vertebral column. Ureters
convey urine in peristaltic waves from the kidney to the urinary bladder. The presence
of urine in the renal pelvis initiates these waves, whose frequency is related to the rate
of urine formation. If this rate is high, a peristaltic wave may occur every few seconds;
if the rate is low, a wave may occur every few minutes. Urinary Bladder
The urinary bladder is a hollow, muscular, distensible sac, located in the base of the
pelvis just behind the pubic symphysis. It is composed of three layers of smooth
muscle tissue lined with mucous membrane containing rugae or wrinkles. The bladder
serves as a temporary reservoir for urine. Voiding, or micturition, is the process in which urine is emptied from the bladder. Two sphincter muscles, the internal sphincter and the external sphincter control the
outflow of urine from the bladder. Ordinarily, the bladder continues to collect urine until
about 200 ml have accumulated, at which time the stretching of the bladder wall
22
activates stretch receptors. Impulses transmitted to the central nervous system
subsequently produce reflex contractions of the bladder wall through parasympathetic
nervous system pathways. As the contractions increase in force and frequency, the
stored urine is forced past the internal sphincter, which is a smooth muscle involuntary
sphincter, into the superior part of the urethra. It is then that a person feels the urge to
void. The inferior external sphincter consists of skeletal muscle and is voluntarily
controlled. If it is not convenient to void, the opening of this sphincter can be inhibited. Conversely, if the time is convenient, the sphincter may be relaxed and the stored urine
flushed from the body. If voiding is inhibited, the reflex contractions of the bladder
cease temporarily and urine continues to accumulate in the bladder. After another 200 to
300 ml of urine has been collected, the micturition reflex will again be initiated. Urethra
The urethra is a membranous tube that carries the flow of urine from the bladder to
the outside of the body. The external opening of the urethra is called the urinary meatus. The female urethra is about 11/2 inches long, lying anterior to the vagina. The male
urethra is about 8 inches long and extends downward through the prostate gland to the
meatus at the tip of the penis. In the male, the urethra has two functions: an outlet for
urine and the passageway for semen to leave the body. Urine
Urine composition reflects the amounts of water and solutes that the kidneys must
eliminate from the body or retain in the internal environment to maintain homeostasis. Urine is normally straw colored to clear. Although it is 95% water, it also contains many
dissolved substances, such as electrolytes, toxins, and nitrogenous wastes. At times the
urine also contains abnormal materials, such as glucose, blood, or albumin. Therefore, analyzing urine gives medical personnel important information regarding disease
processes occurring in a patient. The volume of urine produced usually varies between
0.6 and 2.5 liters per day. The exact volume is influenced by such factors as fluid intake, environmental temperature, relative humidity of the surrounding air, and a person’s
emotional condition, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Normal urine is acidic and
the specific gravity varies from 1.001 to 1.030.

Diagnostic Procedures Relating to This System
Blood urea nitrogen Blood test to measure kidney function by the level of
nitrogenous waste, urea in the blood. Normally the
urea level is low since urea is excreted in the urine
continuously. When the kidney is diseased or fails, however, urea accumulates in the blood (a condition
known as uremia), and this can lead to
unconsciousness and death. Cystoscopy Visual examination of the urinary bladder using an
instrument called a cystoscope. A hollow metal tube is
introduced into the urinary meatus and passed through
the urethra into the bladder. By means of a light
source, special lenses, and mirrors, the bladder mucosa
25
is examined for tumors, calculi, or inflammation. Retrograde pyelogram Contrast material is introduced directly into the
bladder and ureters through a cystoscope, and x-rays
are taken to determine the presence of stones or
obstructions. Urine culture and sensitivity Laboratory test of urine for bacterial infection. Attempt
to grow bacteria on a culture medium in order to
identify it and determine which antibiotics it is
sensitive to. urinalysis Laboratory test that consists of the physical, chemical, and microscopic examination of urine. Pathology
1. Nephrolithiasis
Nephrolithiasis is the process of forming a kidney stone, a stone in the kidney or
lower down in the urinary tract. Causes
Factors predisposing to kidney stones include recent reduction in fluid intake, increased exercise with dehydration, medications that cause hyperuricemia (high uric
acid) and a history of gout. The development of the stones is related to decreased urine
volume or increased excretion of stone-forming components such as calcium, oxalate, urate, and phosphate. The stones form in the urine collecting area (the pelvis) of the
kidney and may range in size. Symptoms
Kidney stones are a common cause of blood in the urine and pain in the abdomen, flank, or groin. The pain with kidney stones is usually of sudden onset, very severe and
intermittent, not improved by changes in position, radiating from the back, down the
flank, and into the groin. Nausea and vomiting are common. Diagnosis
A number of blood and urine tests will be required to detect the presence of
infection and test the function of the kidneys. Urinary tests may also allow the type of
stone to be identified, allowing further guidance of therapy. When urinary stones are
suspected, an x-ray of the abdomen is also required to detect the stones or any other
problem causing a similar set of symptoms. Treatment
Treatment includes relief of pain, hydration and, if there is concurrent urinary
infection, antibiotics. The majority of stones pass spontaneously within 48 hours. However, some stones
may not. There are several factors which influence the ability to pass a stone. These
include the size of the person, prostate enlargement, pregnancy, and the size of the stone.
A 4 mm stone has an 80% chance of passage while a 5 mm stone has a 20% chance. If
the stone can’t pass by itself, surgical removal of the stone may be required. Lithotripsy
may be an alternative to surgery. In this procedure, ultrasonic sound waves or shock
waves are used to break up stones so that they may be expelled in the urine or removed
with an endoscope that is inserted into the kidney in surgery. With resolution or the condition, the patient may be required to avoid certain food
types which may increase the likelihood of developing kidney stones. 2. Pyelonephritis
Pyelonephritis is a serious bacterial infection of the kidney that can be acute or
chronic. Causes
Doctors believe that the bacterial infection causing pyelonephritis may sometimes
develop elsewhere in the body and travel through the bloodstream to the kidney. Far
more commonly, however, the infection is the result of bacteria from outside the body
traveling back up the urinary stream through the urethra to the bladder and eventually to
the kidneys, in which case it is known as an ascending infection. The flow of urine backward is known as reflux and may be caused by an
anatomical defect or by an obstruction. In the former case, instead of a tight valve
between the bladder and the ureter, there is a wide opening. When the bladder contracts
during urination, the urine goes both ways, out through the urethra and back up through
the ureters. The defect is not easy to correct and those who have it are subject to repeat
infections. Reflux can also be caused by the insertion of catheters or instruments such as
cystoscopes for diagnosis or treatment. The introduction of any foreign body into an
area of obstruction is fraught with danger of infection, which can be more difficult to
treat. Symptoms
No matter what the underlying cause, the symptoms of acute bacterial
pyelonephritis are often the same. In the acute infections, the symptoms develop rapidly, the fever noted first, followed by possible changes in the color of the urine, and then
tenderness in the flank. As the kidney becomes more inflamed, pain, loss of appetite, headache, and all the general effects of infection develop. The situation may be especially confusing in children, when high temperature may
suddenly bring on a seizure or a change in mental state, or in the aged, where fever may
bring confusion, or the infection may be masked by generalized aches and pains. There may be irritative voiding symptoms (burning when urinating, a sense of
urgency, or increased frequency of urination). Diagnosis
Your physician will take a medical history, perform a physical exam, and
recommend tests including blood tests and blood cultures, urinalysis and urine culture, and possibly an ultrasound study of the kidneys. 26
Treatment
Treatment centers on antibiotic therapy appropriate to the specific infecting
organism, after identification by urine culture. When the infecting organism cannot be
identified, therapy usually consists of a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Symptoms may
disappear after several days of antibiotic therapy. Although urine usually becomes
sterile within 48 to 72 hours, the course of such therapy is 21 days. Patients with severe infections or complicating factors require hospitalization at
least initially. In some patients, surgery may be necessary to relieve obstruction or
correct an anatomical anomaly. Follow-up treatment includes reculturing the urine several weeks after drug therapy
stops in order to rule-out reinfection. Patients at high risk of recurring urinary tract and kidney infections - such as those
with prolonged use of an indwelling (Foley) catheter- require long-term follow-up. Word List

End-Stage Renal Disease
End-stage renal disease is the name for kidney failure so advanced that it cannot be
reversed ("renal" is another word for kidney). The name is appropriate: the kidneys in
end-stage renal disease function so poorly that they can no longer keep you alive. End-stage renal disease cannot be treated with conventional medical treatments
such as drugs. Only 2 treatments allow you to continue living when your kidneys stop
functioning: dialysis and kidney transplantation. Dialysis is the term for several
different methods of artificially filtering the blood. People who require dialysis are kept
alive but give up some degree of their freedom because of their dialysis schedule, fragile health, or both. Kidney transplantation means replacement of the failed kidneys
with a working kidney from another person, called a donor. Kidney transplantation is
not a complete cure, although many people who receive a kidney transplant are able to
live much as they did before their kidneys failed. People who receive a transplant must
take medication and be monitored by a physician who specializes in kidney disease
(nephrologist) for the rest of their lives. The symptoms of kidney failure vary widely by cause of the kidney failure, severity of the condition, and the other body systems that are affected. Most people
have no symptoms at all in the early stages of the disease, because the kidneys are able
to compensate so well for the early impairments in the their function. Others have
symptoms that are mild, subtle, or vague. Generally, obvious symptoms appear only
when the condition has become severe or even critical. Kidney failure is not painful, even when severe, although there may be pain from damage to other systems. Some
types of kidney failure cause fluid retention, such as Puffiness, swelling of arms and
legs, shortness of breath (due to fluid collection in the lungs, called pulmonary edema. However, severe dehydration (fluid deficiency), with the symptoms as thirst, rapid heart
rate (tachycardia), dry mucous membranes (such as inside the mouth and nose), feeling
weak or lethargic can also cause kidney failure. The most critical part of kidney transplantation is preventing rejection of the graft
kidney. Different transplant centers use different drug combinations to fight rejection of
a transplanted kidney. The drugs work by suppressing your immune system, which is
programmed to reject anything "foreign," such as a new organ. Like any medication, these drugs can have unpleasant side effects. Some of the most common
immune-suppressing drugs used in transplantation are described here. 1) Cyclosporine. This drug interferes with communication between the T cells of the immune system. It
is started immediately after the transplant to suppress your immune system and
continued indefinitely. Common side effects include tremor, high blood pressure, and
kidney damage. These side effects are usually related to the dose and can often be
reversed with proper dosing. 2) Corticosteroids. These drugs block T-cell
communication as well. They are usually given at high doses for a short period
immediately after the transplant and again if rejection is suspected. Corticosteroids have
many different side effects, including easy bruising of the skin, osteoporosis, avascular
necrosis (bone death), high blood pressure, high blood sugar, stomach ulcers, weight
gain, acne, mood swings, and a round face. Because of these side effects, many
transplant centers are trying to reduce the maintenance dose of the drug as much as
possible or even to replace it with other drugs. You must keep follow-up appointments with your transplant team to monitor for
signs of rejection. You will have regular blood and urine tests to detect any signs of
organ failure. One or more ultrasounds of the graft kidney may be done to see if there
are structural abnormalities suggesting rejection. An arteriogram or nuclear medicine
scan may be needed to confirm that blood is flowing to the transplanted kidney. 1. What are the two treatments, which allow you to continue living when the kidneys
stop functioning? Use your words to describe the two treatments. 2. What is the most critical part of kidney transplantation? How to prevent?
1.Dialysis and kidney transplantation. Dialysis is a treatment for kidney failure that rids
your body of unwanted toxins, waste products and excess fluids by filtering your blood. A kidney transplant is an operation that places a healthy kidney in your body. The
transplanted kidney takes over the work of the two kidneys that failed, so you no longer
31
need dialysis. During a transplant, the surgeon places the new kidney in your lower
abdomen and connects the artery and vein of the new kidney to your artery and vein. 2.Preventing rejection of the graft kidney. Use different drug combinations to fight

Reproductive System
Anatomy and Physiology
Most organ systems of the body function almost continuously to maintain the
wellbeing of the individual. The reproductive system, however, appears to “slumber” until puberty. The primary reproductive organs, or gonads, are the testes in males and
the ovaries in females. The gonads produce sex cells, or gametes and secrete sex
hormones. The male’s reproductive role is to manufacture male gametes called sperm, for the female is to produce female gametes, called ova or eggs. When these events are
appropriately timed, a sperm and egg fuse to form a fertilized egg, the first cell of the
new individual, from which all body cells will arise. The sex hormones — androgens in males and estrogens and progesterone in
females — play vital roles both in the development and function of the reproductive
organs and in sexual behavior and drives. These hormones also influence the growth
and development of many other organs and tissues of the body. The remaining diverse collection of reproductive structures —ducts, glands, and
external genitalia—are referred to as accessory reproductive organs. Male and female
reproductive systems are different in shape and structure, but both are specifically
designed to produce, nourish, and transport either the egg or sperm. The male and
female reproductive systems are equal partners in events leading up to fertilization, but
once fertilization has occurred, the female uterus provides a protective environment in
which the embryo develops until birth.
Figure 9.1 Organs of male reproductive system
33
34
Male Reproductive System
The reproductive organs of male, or genitals, are both inside and outside the
pelvis. The male internal genitals include the male gonads, testes; the duct system, which is made up of the epididymis, vas deferens and urethra; and the accessory
glands, which include the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral gland;
while the male external genitals include scrotum and penis. The male reproductive tract and urinary tract share a common passage, the urethra. Thus, the two systems are referred to together as the genitourinary (GU) or urogenital
(UG) tract. The Testes
In a guy who has reached sexual maturity, the two testes, or testicles, produce and
store millions of tiny sperm cells. The
testes are oval-shaped and about 5
centimeters in length and 3 centimeters
in diameter. The testes are also part of
the endocrine system because they
produce hormones, including
testosterone. Testosterone is the
hormone that causes boys to develop
deeper voices, bigger muscles, and body
and facial hair, and it also stimulates the
production of sperm. The outer tunic is the two-layered
tunica vaginalis, derived from the
peritoneum. Deep to tunica vaginalis is
the tunica albuginea, the fibrous
capsule of the testes. Septa extending
from the tunica albuginea divide the
each testis into 250 to 300 wedge-shaped
compartments or lobules. Each lobule contains one to four tightly coiled seminiferous
tubules, the actual “sperm factories.” The seminiferous tubules of each lobule converge
to form a tubulus rectus, a straight tubule that conveys sperm into the rete testis, a
tubular network on the posterior side of the testis. From the rete testis, sperm leave the
testis through the efferent ductules and enter the epididymis, which hugs the external
surface of the testis. The Male Duct System
Sperm travel from the testes to the outside of the body through a system of ducts. The accessory ducts are the epididymis, the vas deferens (or ductus deferens), and the
urethra. The Epididymis
The comma-shaped epididymis is about 3.8cm long. Its head, which joins the
Figure 9.2 Structure of testes
efferent ductules, caps the superior part of the testis. Its body and tail regions lie on the
posterolateral part of the testis. The immature, nearly nonmotile sperm that leave the
testes move slowly through the duct of the epididymis. As they move along its tortuous
course, a trip that takes about 20 days, sperm gain the ability to swim. When a male is
sexually stimulated and ejactulates, the smooth muscle in the wall of the epididymis
contracts, expelling sperm from its tail into the next segment of the duct system, the
ductus deferens. However, sperm can be stored in the epididymis for several months. If
held longer, they are eventually phagocytized by epithelial cells of the epididymis. The Ductus Deferens
The vas deferens or ductus deferens, is about 45cm long. It runs upward as part of
the spermatic cord from the epididymis through the inguinal canal into the pelvic cavity. It is easily palpated as it passes anterior to the pubic bone. It then loops medially over
the ureter and descends along the posterior wall of the bladder. Its terminus expands to
form the ampulla and then joins with the duct of the seminal vesicle to form the short
ejaculatory duct. Each ejaculatory duct, in turn, passes into the prostate gland where
it empties into the urethra. The ductus deferens propels live sperm from their storage sites, the epididymis and
distal part of the ductus deferens, into the urethra. At the moment of ejaculation, the
thick layers of smooth muscle in the wall of the ductus deferens create strong peristaltic
waves that rapidly squeeze the sperm forward. The Urethra
The urethra is the terminal portion of the male duct system. It conveys both urine
and semen, so it serves both the urinary and reproductive systems. The three regions of
the urethra are: the prostatic urethra, which is the portion surrounded by the prostate
gland, the membranous urethra in the urogenital diaphragm, and the spongy urethra, which runs through the penis and opens to the outside at the external urethral orifice. The spongy urethra is about 15 cm long and accounts for 75% of urethral length. The Accessory Glands
The accessory glands include the paired seminal vesicles, bulbourethral glands, and the single prostate gland. These glands produce the bulk of semen, the mixture of
sperm and accessory gland secretions. The Seminal Vesicles
The seminal vesicles lie on the posterior wall of the bladder. Seminal vesicles are 5
to 7 cm in length, and in the shape of a little finger. Their secretion, which accounts for
about 60% of the volume of semen, is a yellowish viscous alkaline fluid containing
fructose sugar, ascorbic acid, a coagulating enzyme, and prostaglandins. The duct of
each seminal vesicle joins that of the ductus deferens on the same side to form the
ejaculatory duct. Sperm and seminal fluid mix in the ejaculatory duct and enter the
prostatic urethra together during ejaculation. The Prostate Gland
35
The prostate gland is a single doughnut-shaped gland, about the size of a chestnut. It encircles the part of the urethra just inferior to the bladder. The prostatic gland
secretion, which accounts for up to one third of the semen volume, is a milky, slightly
acid fluid that contains citrate and several enzymes, and prostate specific antigen, and it
plays a role in activating sperms. It enters the prostatic urethra via several ducts when
prostatic smooth muscle contracts during ejaculation. The Bulbourethral Glands
The bulbourethral glands, also called Cowper’s glands, are pea sized glands
situated inferior to the prostate gland. They produce a thick, clear mucus prior to
ejaculation that drains into the spongy urethra and neutralizes traces of acidic urine in
the urethra. The Scrotum
The scrotum is a sac of skin and superficial fascia that hangs outside the
abdominopelvic cavity at the root of the penis. The paired oval testes, or testicles, lie in
the scrotum. A midline septum divides the scrotum into right and left halves, providing
one compartment for each testis. This location seems a rather vulnerable position for a
man’s testes, which contain his entire genetic heritage. However, viable sperm cannot be
produced at core body temperature (36.2 ℃ ). Hence the superficial location of the
scrotum, which provides a temperature about 3℃ lower, is an essential adaption. Furthermore, the scrotum responds to the changes of temperature. When it is cold, the
testes are pulled closer to the warmth of the body wall, and the scrotum becomes shorter
and heavily wrinkled to reduce heat loss. When it is warm, the scrotal skin is flaccid and
loose to increase the surface area for cooling, and the testes hang lower. These changes
in scrotal surface area help maintain a fairly constant intrascrotal temperature and reflect
the activity of two sets of muscles. The dartos muscle, a layer of smooth muscle in the
superficial fascia, wrinkles the scrotal skin. The cremaster muscles, bands of skeletal
muscle that arise from the internal oblique muscles of the trunk, elevate the testes. The Penis
The penis is to deliver sperm into the female reproductive tract. The penis and
scrotum make up the external reproductive structures, or external genitalia, of the male. The male perineum is the diamond shaped region located between the pubic symphysis
anteriorly, the coccyx posteriorly, and the ischial tuberosities laterally. The penis consists of an attached root and a free shaft or body that ends in an
enlarged tip, the glans penis. The skin covering the penis is loose, and it slides distally
to form a cuff of skin called the prepuce, or foreskin, around the glans. Frequently, the
foreskin is surgically removed shortly after birth, a procedure called circumcision. Semen
Semen is a milky white, somewhat sticky mixture of sperm and accessory glands
secretions. The liquid provides a transport medium and nutrients and contains chemicals
that protect and activate the sperm and facilitate their movement. Mature sperm cells are
streamlined cellular “missiles” containing very little cytoplasm or stored nutrients. The
36
fructose in seminal vesicle secretion provides nearly all their fuel. The prostaglandins in
semen decrease the viscosity of mucus guarding the entry of the uterus and stimulate
reverse peristalsis in the uterus and the medial parts of the uterine tubes, facilitating the
movement of sperms through the female reproductive tract. The hormone relaxin and
certain enzymes in semen enhance sperm motility. The relative alkalinity of semen as a
whole (pH7.2-7.6) helps neutralize the acid environment of the male’s urethra and the
female’s vagina. Thus, it protects the delicate sperms and enhances their motility. Sperm
are very sluggish under acidic conditions (below pH6). Semen also contains an
antibiotic chemical called seminal plasmin, which destroys certain bacteria. Clotting
factors (fibrinogen and others) found in semen coagulate it just after ejaculation. Then, its contained fibrinolysin liquefies the sticky mass, enabling the sperm to swim out and
begin their journey through the female duct system. The amount of semen propelled out of the male duct system during ejaculation is
relatively small, only 2-5 ml, but there are between 50 and 130 million sperm per
milliliter. Female Reproductive System
FIGURE 3 Midsagittal section of the female pelvis, showing internal organs of the female
reproductive system. The reproductive role of the female is far more complex than that of a male. Not
only must she produce gametes, but her body must prepare to nurture a developing
embryo for a period of approximately nine months. Ovaries, the female gonads, are the
37
primary reproductive organs of a female.Ovaries serve a dual purpose: the production of
the eggs, and the secretion of the female sex hormones, the estrogens and progesterone. The accessory ducts, which contain the uterine tubes, uterus, and vagina, transport or
otherwise serve the needs of the reproductive cells and a developing fetus. The ovaries and duct system, collectively known as the internal genitalia, are
mostly located in the pelvic cavity. The external sex organs of females are referred to
as the external genitalia.
FIGURE 4 Structure of an ovary. The ovary has been sectioned to reveal the follicles in its
interior. Note that not all of these structures would appear in the ovary at the same time. The Ovaries
The paired ovaries, which flank the uterus on each side, are shaped like almonds
and about twice as large. Each ovary is held in place within the peritoneal cavity by
several ligaments. The ovarian ligament anchors the ovary laterally to the uterus; the
suspensory ligament anchors it laterally to the pelvic wall; and the mesovarium
suspends it in between. Both the suspensory ligament and the mesovarium are part of
the broad ligament, a peritoneal fold that “tents” over the uterus and supports the uterine
tubes, uterus, and vagina. The ovaries are served by the ovarian arteries, branches of the abdominal aorta, and by the ovarian branch of the uterine arteries. The ovary has an outer cortex, which
houses the forming gametes, and an inner medullary region, which contains the largest
blood vessels and nerves. But the relative extent of each region is poorly defined. Embedded in the highly vascular connective tissue of the ovary cortex are many
tiny saclike structures called ovarian follicles. Each follicle conisists of an immature egg, called an oocyte, encased by one or more layers of very different cells. Follicles at
different stages of maturation are distinguished by their structure. In a primordial
follicle, one layer of squamouslike follicle cells surrounds the oocyte. A primary follicle
has two or more layers of cuboidal or columnar type granulosa cells enclosing the
oocyte. It becomes a secondary follicle when fluid-filled spaces appear between the
granulose cells and then coalesce to form a central fluid-filled cavity called an antrum. At its most mature stage, when it is called a vesicular, or Graafian follicle, the follicle
bulges from the surface of the ovary. The oocyte of the vesicular follicle “sits” on a stalk
38
of granulose cells at one side of the antrum. Each month in adult women, one of the
ripening follicles ejects its oocyte from the ovary, an event called ovulation. After
ovulation, the ruptured follicle is transformed into a very different looking structure
called the corpus luteum, which eventually degenerates. As a rule, most of these
structures can be seen within the same ovary. In older women, the surfaces of the
ovaries are scarred and pitted, revealing that many oocytes have been released.
FIGURE 5 Ovulation. A secondary oocyte is released from a follicle at the surface of the
ovary. The Female Duct System
The Uterine Tubes
The uterine tubes, also called fallopian tubes or oviducts, form the initial part of
the female duct system. They receive the ovulated oocyte and provide a site where
fertilization can occur. Each uterine tube is about 10cm long and extends medially from
the region of an ovary to empty into the superolateral region of the uterus via a
constricted region called the isthmus. The distal end of each uterine tube expands as it
curves around the ovary, forming the ampulla; fertilization usually occurs in this region. The ampulla ends in the infundibulum, an open, funnel-shaped structure bearing
ciliated, fingerlike projections called fimbriae that drape over the ovary. Unlike the
male duct system, which is continuous with the tubules of the testes, the uterine tubes
have little or no actual contact with the ovaries. An ovulated oocyte is cast into the
peritoneal cavity, and many oocytes are lost there. However, the uterine tube performs a
complex sequence of movements to capture oocytes. Specifically, the infundibulum
bends to drape over the ovary while the fimbriae stiffen and sweep the ovarian surface. The beating cilia on the fimbriae then create currents in the peritoneal fluid that act to
carry the oocyte into the uterine tube, where it begins its journey toward the uterus. 39
FIGURE 6 Internal reproductive organs of a female. Posterior view of the female reproductive
organs. The posterior walls of the vagina, uterus, and uterine tubes and the broad ligament have been
removed on the right side to reveal the shape of the lumen of these organs. The Uterus
The uterus is located in the pelvis, anterior to the rectum and posterosuperior to
the bladder. It is a hollow, thick-walled organ that functions to receive, retain, and
nourish a fertilized ovum. In a premenopausal woman who has never been pregnant, the
uterus is about the size and shape of an inverted pear, but it is usually somewhat larger
in women who have borne children. Normally, the uterus is flexed anteriorly where it
joins the vagina, causing the uterus as a whole to be inclined forward or anteverted. However, the organ is frequently turned backward, or retroverted, in older women. The major portion of the uterus is referred to as the body. The rounded region
superior to the entrance of the uterine tubes is the fundus, and the slightly narrowed
region between the body and the cervix is the isthmus. The cervix of the uterus is its
narrow neck, or outlet, which projects into the vagina inferiorly. The cavity of the
cervix, called the cervical canal, communicates with the vagina via the external os and
with the cavity of the uterine body via the internal os. The mucosa of the cervical canal
contains cervical glands that secrete a mucus that fills the cervical canal and covers the
external os, presumably to block the spread of bacteria from the vagina into the uterus. Cervical mucus also blocks the entry of sperm, except at midcycle, when it becomes
less viscous and allows sperms to pass through. The wall of the uterus is composed of three layers: the perimetrium, the
myometrium, and the endometrium. The perimetrium, the outermost serous layer, is
the visceral peritoneum. The myometrium is the bulky middle layer, composed of
interlacing bundles of smooth muscle. The myometrium contracts rhythmically during
childbirth to expel the baby from the mother’s body. The endometrium is the mucosal
40
lining of the uterine cavity; it is a simple columnar epithelium underlain by a thick
lamina propria of highly cellular connective tissue. If fertilization occurs, the young
embryo burrows into the endometrium and resides there for the rest of its development. The Vagina
The vagina is a thin-walled tube, 8-10 cm long. It lies between the bladder and the
rectum and extends from the cervix to the body exterior. The urethra is embedded in its
anterior wall. Often called the birth canal, the vagina provides a passageway for
delivery of an infant and for menstrual flow. Since it receives the penis during sexual
intercourse, it is the female organ of copulation. The External Genitalia
The female reproductive structures that lie external to the vagina are called the
external genitalia. The external genitalia, also called the vulva, include the mons pubis, labia, clitoris, and structures associated with the vestibule. The Mammary Glands
The mammary glands are present in both sexes, but they normally function only
in females. Since the biological role of the mammary glands is to produce milk to
nourish a newborn baby, they are actually important only when reproduction has already
been accomplished. Developmentally, mammary glands are modified sweat glands that are really part
of the skin, or integumentary system. Each mammary gland is contained within a
rounded skin-covered breast anterior to the pectoral muscles of the thorax. Slightly
below the center of each breast is a ring of pigmented skin, the areola, which surrounds
a central protruding nipple. Large sebaceous glands in the areola make it slightly
bumpy and produce sebum that reduces chapping and cracking of the skin of the nipple. Autonomic nervous system, which controls of smooth muscle fibers in the areola and
nipple, causes the nipple to become erect when stimulated by tactile or sexual stimuli
and when exposed to cold. Internally, each mammary gland consists of 15 to 25 lobes
that radiate around and open at the nipple. The lobes are padded and separated from
each other by fibrous connective tissue and fat. The interlobar connective tissue forms
suspensory ligaments that attach the breast to the underlying muscle fascia and to the
overlying dermis. As suggested by their name, the suspensory ligaments provide natural
support for the breasts, like a built-in brassiere. Within the lobes are smaller units called
lobules, which contain glandular alveoli that produce milk when a woman is lactating. These compound alveolar glands pass the milk into the lactiferous ducts, which open to
the outside at the nipple. Just deep to the areola, each lactiferous duct has a dilated
region called a lactiferous sinus. Milk accumulates in these sinuses during nursing.
41
FIGURE 7 Structure of lactating mammary glands. (a) Anterior view of a partially dissected breast. (b) Sagittal section of a breast. Pregnancy
Pregnancy refers to the period of time during which a baby grows and develops in
its mother’s uterus. The normal length of time for a pregnancy, gestation, is 40 weeks. If a baby is born before completing at least 37 weeks of gestation, it is considered
premature. During pregnancy the female body undergoes many changes. In fact, all of the
body systems become involved in the development of a healthy infant. From the time
the fertilized egg implants in the uterus until approximately the end of the eighth week, the infant is referred to as an embryo. This is a period of rapid growth and formation of
the major organ systems. Following the embryo stage until birth, the infant is called a
fetus.The fetus receives nourishment from its mother by way of the placenta, which is a
spongy structure that forms in the uterus next to the fetus. The placenta is commonly
referred to as the afterbirth. The fetus is attached to the placenta by way of the
umbilical cord. The fetus is surrounded by two membranous sacs, the amnion and the
chorion. The amnion is the innermost sac and it holds the amniotic fluid in which the
fetus floats. The chorion is an outer, protective sac and also forms part of the placenta. Labor is the actual process of expelling the fetus from the uterus and through the
vagina. The first stage is referred to as the dilation stage, in which the uterine muscles
contract strongly to expel the fetus. During this process the fetus presses on the cervix
and causes it to dilate or expand. As the cervix dilates, it also becomes thinner, referred
to as effacement. When the cervix is completely dilated to 10 centimeters, the second
stage of labor begins. This is the expulsion stage and ends with delivery of the baby. Generally, the head of the baby appears first, which is referred to as crowning. In some
cases the baby’s buttocks will appear first, and this is referred to as a breech
presentation. The last stage of labor is the placental stage. Immediately after childbirth, 42
43
the uterus continues to contract, causing the placenta to be expelled through the vagina.

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infectious diseases spread through sexual
contact. As a group, STDs are the single most important cause of reproductive
disorders. 1. Gonorrhea
The causative agent of gonorrhea is Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which invades the
mucosae of the reproductive and urinary tracts. These bacteria are spread by contact
with genital, anal, and pharyngeal mucosal surfaces. Most cases occur in adolescents
and young adults. The most frequent symptom of gonorrhea in males is urethritis, accompanied by
painful urination and discharge of pus from the penis. Symptoms vary in women, ranging from none (about 20% of cases) to abdominal discomfort, vaginal discharge, abnormal uterine bleeding, and occasionally, urethral symptoms similar to those seen in
males.Untreated gonorrhea can cause urethral constriction and inflammation of the entire
male duct system. In women, it causes pelvic inflammatory disease and sterility. These
consequences declined with the advent in the 1950s of penicillin, tetracycline, and
certain other antibiotics. However, strains resistant to those antibiotics are becoming
increasingly prevalent. 2. Syphilis
Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, a corkscrew-shaped bacterium, is usually
transmitted sexually. However, it can be contracted congenitally from an infected
mother. Fetuses infected with syphilis are usually stillborn or die shortly after birth. The
bacterium easily penetrates intact mucosae and abraded skin and enters the local
lymphatics and the blood stream. Within a few hours of exposure, an asymptomatic
body wide infection is in progress. The incubation period is typically two to three weeks, at the end of which a red, painless primary lesion called a chancre appears at the site of
bacterial invasion. In males, this is typically the penis, but in females the lesion often
goes undetected within the vagina or on the cervix. The primary lesion ulcerates and
becomes crusty; then it heals spontaneously and disappears after one to a few weeks.
46
If syphilis is untreated, its secondary signs appear several weeks later. A pink skin
rash all over the body is one of the first symptoms. Fever and joint pain are common. Anemia may develop, and the hair may fall out in clumps. These signs and symptoms
disappear spontaneously in three to twelve weeks. Then the disease enters the latent
period and is detectable only by a blood test. The latent stage may last a person’s
lifetime (or the bacteria may be killed by the immune system), or it may be followed by
the signs of tertiary syphilis. Tertiary syphilis is characterized by gummas, destructive
lesions of the central nervous system, blood vessels, bones, and skin. Penicillin, which
interferes with the ability of dividing bacteria to synthesize new cell walls, is still the
treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis. Word List

Ⅵ. Case study: High-risk obstetrics consultation report
Reason for Consultation: High-risk pregnancy with late-term bleeding
History of Present Illness:
Patient is 23 years old. She is currently estimated to be at 240 days of gestation. She has had a 23-lb weight gain with this pregnancy. Amniocentesis at 20 weeks
indicated male fetus with no evidence of genetic or developmental disorders. She
noticed a moderate degree of vaginal bleeding this morning but denies any cramping or
pelvic pain. She immediately saw her obstetrician who referred her for high-risk
evaluation. Past Medical History:
This patient is multigravida but nullipara with three early miscarriages without
obvious cause. She was diagnosed with cancer of the left ovary 4 years ago. It was
50
51
treated with a left oophorectomy and chemotherapy. She continues to undergo full-body
CT scan every 6 months, and there has been no evidence of metastasis since that time. Menarche was at age 13 and her menstrual history is significant for menorrhagia
resulting in chronic anemia. Results of Physical Examination:
Patient appears well nourished and abdominal girth appears consistent with length
of gestation. She is understandably quite anxious regarding the sudden spotting. Pelvic
ultrasound indicates placenta previa with placenta almost completely overlying cervix. However, there is no evidence of abruption placentae at this time. The fetus is turned
head down and the umbilical cord is not around the neck. The fetal heart tones are
strong with a rate of 90 beats/minute. There is no evidence of cervical effacement or
dilation at this time. Recommendations:
Fetus appears to be developing well and in no distress at this time. The placenta
appears to be well attached on ultrasound, but the bleeding is cause for concern. With
the extremely low position of the placenta, this patient is at very high risk for abruption
placentae when cervix begins effacement and dilation. She may require early delivery
by cesarean section at that time. She will definitely require C-section at onset of labor. At this time, recommend bed rest with bathroom privileges. She is to return every other
day for 2 weeks and every day after that for evaluation of cervix and fetal condition. She is to call immediately if she notes any further bleeding or chage in activity level of
the fetus. Critical Thinking Questions
1. Describe in your own words the treatment this patient received for her ovarian
cancer. What procedure does she continue to have every 5 months?
2. Describe in your own words this patient’s menstrual history. 3. Which of the following choices describes this patient (choose all that apply)?
a. She has never been pregnant. b. She has several live children. c. She has no live children. d. She has been pregnant several times. 4. This patient has placenta previa. What procedure discovered this condition? The
physician, however, is much more concerned about abruption placentae. Explain
why. 5. Describe the condition of the fetus. 6. The following two phrases are not specifically defined by your text. Explain what
you believe them to mean based on the context of this consultation report. a. high-risk pregnancy
b. abdominal girth appears consistent with length of gestation

Endocrine System
Anatomy and Physiology
The endocrine system is a collection of glands that secrete hormones directly into
the bloodstream. Hormones are chemicals that act on their target organs to either
increase or decrease the target’s activity level. Hormones are released into the extracellular spaces surrounding secretory cells. Paracrine hormones travel only short distances and affect nearby cells. Other hormones
are carried by the blood to all parts of the body and may produce general effects. In
either case, the physiological action of a particular hormone is restricted to its target
cells – those cells that possess specific receptors for the hormone molecules. In other
words, a hormone’s target cells have receptors that other cells lack. Endocrine glands and their hormones help regulate metabolic processes. They
control the rates of certain chemical reactions, aid in transporting substances through
membranes, and help regulate water balance, electrolyte balance, and blood pressure. In
this way the endocrine system is instrumental in maintaining homeostasis, that is, adjusting the activity level of most of the tissues and organs of the body to maintain a
stable internal environment. The body actually has two distinct types of glands: exocrine glands and endocrine
glands. Exocrine glands release their secretions into a duct that carries them to the
outside of the body. For example, sweat glands release sweat into a sweat duct that
travels to the surface of the body. Endocrine glands, however, release hormones directly
into the bloodstream. The secretion of the thyroid gland directly enters the bloodstream. Because they have no ducts, they are referred to as ductless glands. The endocrine system consists of the following glands: the pituitary gland, the
pineal gland, the thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, the adrenal glands, the thymus
gland, the pancreas, testes in the male, and ovaries in the female. The endocrine
glands as a whole affect the functions of the entire body. Some hormones are produced by organs other than the endocrine glands already
mentioned. For example, the kidney secretes a hormone called erythropoietin, which
stimulate the production of red blood cells by the bone marrow. The gastrointestinal
tract secretes three hormones, gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin. These hormones
stimulate the secretion of gastric acid and enzymes (gastrin), the secretion of pancreatic
enzymes (secretin), and the contraction of the gallbladder (cholecystokinin).The skin
produces vitamin D, which is also considered a hormone. Vitamin D stimulates the
absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract and is necessary for the
maintenance of proper amounts of calcium in the bones and in the blood.
53
Figure 10.1 Organs of endocrine system
Pituitary Gland
The pituitary gland, also called hypophysis, is located at the base of the brain in a
small depression of the skull called the sella turcica. The small pea-sized gland is
divided into an anterior lobe called the adenohypophysis, which is formed by an
upgrowth from the pharynx and is glandular in nature; and a posterior lobe called
neurohypophysis, which is derived from a downgrowth from the base of the brain and
is composed of nervous tissue. Both lobes are controlled by the hypothalamus in the
brain.
Figure 10.2 location of pituitary and hypothalamus
The anterior pituitary secretes several different hormones. Growth hormone (GH), 54
55
The pineal gland is a small pine cone-shaped
gland that is part of the thalamus region of the
brain. The pineal gland secretes melatonin. This
hormone is not well understood, but plays a role in
regulating the body’s circadian rhythm. This is
the 24-hour clock that governs our periods of
wakefulness and sleepiness.
also called somatotropin, promotes growth of the body by stimulating cells to rapidly
increase in size and divide. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) regulates the function
of the thyroid gland. Adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) regulates the function of
the adrenal cortex. Prolactin (PRL) stimulates milk production in the breast following
pregnancy and birth. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)
both exert their influence on the male and female gonads. FSH is responsible for the
development of ova in ovaries and sperm in testes. It also stimulates the ovary to secrete
estrogen. LH stimulates secretion of sex hormones in both males and females and plays
a role in releasing ova in females. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) stimulates
melanocytes to produce more melanin, thereby darkening the skin. The posterior pituitary releases two hormones that are actually produced in the
hypothalamus. These hormones, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin (OT), are
stored in the posterior pituitary until nervous signals arrive from the hypothalamus to
trigger their release. Antidiuretic hormone, also called vasopressin, promotes water
reabsorption by the kidney tubules. ADH can also increase blood pressure by
constricting arterioles. Oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions during labor and
delivery, and after birth the release of milk from the mammary glands.

Thyroid Gland
.
Parathyroid Glands
Thymus Gland
Child Adult
In addition to its role as part of immune system, the thymus is also one of the
endocrine glands because it secretes the hormone thymosin. Thymosin, like the rest of
the thymus gland, is important for proper development of the immune system. The
The four tiny parathyroid glands are located
on the dorsal surface of the thyroid gland. The
parathyroid hormone secreted by these glands
regulates the amount of calcium in the blood. If
calcium levels in the blood fall too low, parathyroid hormone levels in the blood are
increased and will stimulate bone breakdown to
release more calcium into the blood.
The thyroid gland, which resembles a
butterfly in shape, has right and left lobes. It is
located on either side of the trachea and larynx. The thyroid cartilage, or Adam’s apple, is
located just above the thyroid gland. This gland
produces the hormones thyroxine, which is also
known as T4 , and triiodothyronine, which is
called T3 . These hormones are produced in the
thyroid gland from the mineral iodine. T3 and T4
help to regulate the production of energy and
heat in the body to adjust the metabolic rate of
the body. The thyroid gland also secretes calcitonin
in response to hypercalcemia. Its action is the
opposite of parathyroid hormone and stimulates
the increased deposition of calcium into bone, thereby lowering blood levels of calcium.
thymus gland is located in the mediastinal cavity anterior and superior to the heart. The
thymus is present at birth and grows to its largest size during puberty. At puberty it
begins to shrink and eventually is replaced with connective and adipose tissue. The most important function of the thymus is the development of the immune
system in the newborn. It is essential to the growth and development of thymic
lymphocytes or T cells, which are critical for the body’s immune system. The complete
function of the thymus gland is not very well understood. Adrenal Glands
The two adrenal glands are located above each of the kidneys. Each gland is
composed of two sections: adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. The outer adrenal cortex
manufactures several different families of hormones: mineralocorticoids , glucocorticoids, and steroid sex hormones. However, because they are all produced by
the cortex they are collectively referred to as corticosteroids. The mineralocorticoids
hormone, aldosterone, regulates sodium and potassium levels in the body. The
secretion of aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium into the bloodstream by
the kidney tubules. At the same time, it stimulates the excretion of another eletrocyte
called potassium. The glucocorticoid hormone, cortisol, have an important influence on
the metabolism of sugar, fat, and proteins within all body cells and have a powerful
anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisone is a hormone very similar to cortisol and can be
prepared synthetically. Cortisone is useful in treating inflammatory conditions such as
rheumatoid arthritis. The adrenal cortex of both men and women secretes steroid sex
hormones: androgens, estrogen, and progesterone. These hormones regulate
secondary sexual characteristics. All hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex are
steroid hormones. The inner portion of the adrenal medulla is responsible for secreting the hormones
epinephrine and norepinephrine. Epinephrine is also called adrenaline. Epinephrine
can increase cardiac rate, dilates bronchial tubes, and stimulate the production of
glucose from a storage substance called glycogen when glucose is need by the body. Norepinephrine can constrict vessels and raise blood pressure. These hormones are
57
critical during emergency situations because they increase blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration levels. This helps the body perform better during emergencies or
otherwise stressful times. Pancreas
The pancreas is located along the lower curvature of the stomach. It is the only
organ in the body that has both endocrine and exocrine functions. The exocrine portion
of the pancreas releases digestive enzymes through a duct into the duodenum of the
small intestines. The endocrine sections of the pancreas, islets of Langerhans, are named
after Dr.Paul Langerhans, a German anatomist. The islets cells produce two different
hormones: insulin and glucagon. Insulin, produced by B islet cells, stimulates the cells
of the body to take in glucose from the bloodstream. Loss or impairment of the function
of insulin results in diabetes mellitus (DM) and hyperglycemia, which is a high blood
sugar level. In contrast, overproduction of insulin will result in hypoglycemia, or a low
blood sugar level. There are two distinctly different types of diabetes mellitus: type 1and type 2. In
type 1 there is a destruction of the islet cells and the person fails to produce an adequate
amount of insulin. Therefore, he or she must take insulin injections to replace the insulin
the pancreas is unable to produce. Type 1 is also called insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus (IDDM). In type 2 diabetes mellitus the person makes a sufficient amount of
insulin, but it has lost its ability to influence the cells of the body. These patients (except
in severe cases ) do not take insulin. Therefore type 2 is also called
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) . This type of DM is usually treated
by diet, exercise, and oral hypoglycemic agents—medications that result in a more
normal blood sugar level. Another set of islet cells, the a cells, secrete a different hormone, glucagon, in
response to hypoglycemia. Glucagon stimulates the liver to release glucose, thereby
raising the blood glucose level. Glucagon is released when the body needs more sugar , such as at the beginning of strenuous activity or several hours after the last meal has
been digested. Insulin and glucagon have opposite effects on blood sugar level. When blood sugar
(glucose) is above normal level, insulin is released by the islet cells of the pancreas. The
58
59
insulin causes glucose to enter body cells to be used for energy and stimulate the
conversion of glucose to glycogen (a starch-storage form of sugar) in the liver. Thus, sugar can leave the blood to be stored or used to release energy. Glucagons, the opposite
twin of the insulin, is released into the blood when sugar levels are below normal. It
causes the breakdown of stored liver glycogen to glucose, so that there is a rise in the
sugar content of blood leaving the liver. In a word, insulin will reduce the blood sugar
level, while glucagon will increase it. Ovaries
The two ovaries are located in the lower abdominopelvic cavity of the female. They are the female gonads. Gonads are organs that produce gametes, or the
reproductive sex cells. In the case of the females, the gametes are the ova. Of
importance to the endocrine system, the ovaries produce the female sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen is responsible for the appearance of the female
sexual characteristics (sexual desire, body hair growth, breast development and
feminine body features) and regulation of the menstrual cycle. Progesterone helps to
maintain a suitable uterine environment for pregnancy. Testes
The testes are two oval glands located in the scrotal sac of the male. They are the
male gonads, which produce the male gametes, sperm, and the male sex hormone. The
interstitial cells can produce the male hormone－testosterone. Testosterone produces
the male secondary sexual characteristics and regulates sperm production. Table 1: Endocrine Glands and Their Hormones

Diagnostic Procedures Relating to the System
62
Blood Serum Test Blood test to measure the level of substances such as
calcium, electrolytes, testosterone, insulin, and
glucose. It is used to assist in determining the
function of various endocrine glands. Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) Blood test to measure the amount of sugar
circulating throughout the body after a 12-hour fast. Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) Test to determine the blood sugar level. A measured
dose of glucose is given to a patient either orally or
intravenously. Blood samples are then drawn at
certain intervals to determine the ability of the
patient to use glucose. It is used for diabetic patients
to determine their insulin response to glucose. Protein-bound Iodine Test Blood test to measure the concentration of thyroxine
(T4) circulating in the bloodstream. The iodine
becomes bound to the protein in the blood and can be
measured. It is useful in establishing thyroid
function. Thyroid Function Test (TFT) Blood test used to measure the levels of T3, T4, and
TSH in the bloodstream to assist in determining
thyroid function. Pathology to the System
1.acidosis Excessive acidity of body fluids due to the accumulation of acids, as in
diabetic acidosis. 2.acromegaly Chronic disease of adults that results in an elongation and enlargement of
the bones of the head and extremities. There can also be mood changes. 3.Addison's disease Disease named for Thomas Addison, a British physician, that
results from a deficiency in adrenocortical hormones. There may be an increased
pigmentation of the skin, generalized weakness, and weight loss. 4.cretinism Congenital condition due to a lack of thyroid that may result in arrested
physical and mental development. 5.Cushing's syndrome Set of symptoms named after Harvey Cushing, an American
neurosurgeon that result from hypersecretion of the adrenal cortex. This may be the
result of a tumor of the adrenal glands. The syndrome may present symptoms of
weakness, edema, excess hair growth, skin discoloration, and osteoporosis. 6.diabetes insipidus (DI) Disorder caused by the inadequate secretion of a hormone by
the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. There may be polyuria and polydipsia. This is
more common in the young. 7.diabetes mellitus A series disease in which the pancreas fails to produce insulin or the
insulin does not work properly. Consequently, the patient has very high blood sugar. The
kidney will attempt to lower the high blood sugar level by excreting excess sugar in the
urine. 8.diabetic retinopathy Secondary complication of diabetes that affects the blood
vessels of the retina, resulting in visual changes and even blindness. 9.dwarfism Condition of being abnormally small. It may be the result of a hereditary
condition or an endocrine dysfunction. 10.exophthalmos Condition in which the eyeballs protrude, such as in Graves' disease. This is generally caused by an overproduction of thyroid hormone. 11.gigantism Excessive development of the body due to the overproduction of the
growth hormone by the pituitary gland. The opposite of dwarfism. 12.goiter Enlargement of the thyroid gland. 13.Graves' disease Condition, named for Robert Graves, an Irish physician, that results
in overactivity of the thyroid gland and can result in a crisis situation. It is also called
hyperthyroidism. 13.Hashimoto's thyroiditis Chronic form of thyroiditis, named for a Japanese surgeon. 14.hyperthyroidism Condition resulting from overactivity of the thyroid gland that can
result in a crisis situation. It is also called Graves' disease. 15.hypothyroidism Result of a deficiency in secretion by the thyroid gland. This results
in a lowered basal metabolism rate with obesity, dry skin, slow pulse, low blood
pressure, sluggishness, and goiter. Treatment is replacement with synthetic thyroid
hormone. 16.insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) Also called type 1 diabetes mellitus;
it develops early in life when the pancreas stops insulin production. Persons with IDDM
must take daily insulin injections. 17.ketoacidosis Acidosis due to an excess of ketone bodies (waste products). A serious
condition that requires immediate treatment and can result in death for the diabetic
patient if not reversed. 18.non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus Also called type 2 diabetes mellitus. It
develops later in life when the pancreas produces insufficient insulin; persons may take
oral hypoglycemics to stimulate insulin secretion, or may eventually have to take insulin. 19.obesity Having an abnormal amount of fat in the body. 20.peripheral neuropathy Damage to the nerves in the lower legs and hands as a result
of diabetes mellitus; symptoms include either extreme sensitivity or numbness and
tingling. 21.tetany A condition the results from a calcium deficiency in the blood. It is
characterized by muscle twitches, cramps, and spasms. 22.thyrotoxicosis Condition that results from overproduction of the thyroid glands. Symptoms include a rapid heart action, tremors, enlarged thyroid gland, exophthalmos, and weight loss. Word List

Discharge Summary
Admitting Diagnosis: Hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, glycosuria
Final Diagnosis: New-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus
History of Present Illness: Patient presented to pediatrician’s office with a 2-month
history of weight loss, fatigue, polyuria, and polydipsia. Her family history is significant
for a grandfather, mother, and older brother with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The
pediatrician found hyperglycemia with a fasting blood sugar and glycosuria with a urine
dipstick. Patient was also noted to be dehydrated and extremely lethargic. She is being
admitted at this time for management of new-onset diabetes mellitus. Summary of Hospital Course: At the time of admission, the FBS was 300 mg/100 mL
and she was in ketoacidosis. She rapidly improved after receiving insulin; her serum
glucose level normalized, and her lethargy disappeared. The next day a 2-hour
postprandial glucose tolerance test confirmed the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus while an
abdominal X-ray and a pancreas CT scan were normal. There was no evidence of
diabetic retinopathy. Attempts to control hyperglycemia with oral hypoglycemics were
not successful and patient was started on insulin injections. She was discharged 3 days
later on a protocol of b.i.d. (twice a day) insulin injections. The patient and her family
were instructed in diet, exercise, symptoms of hypoglycemic coma, and long-term
complications of diabetes mellitus. Discharge Plans: Patient was discharged to home with her parents. She is on a
2,000-calorie ADA diet with three meals and two snacks. She may engage in any
activity and may return to school next Monday. Her parents are to check her serum
glucose levels b.i.d. and call the office for insulin dosage. She is to return to the office in

Reading Practice
All about Diabetes
Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin. Insulin
is a hormone that is needed to convert sugar, starches and other food into energy needed
for daily life. The cause of diabetes continues to be a mystery, although both genetics
and environmental factors such as obesity and lack of exercise appear to play roles. In order to determine whether or not a patient has pre-diabetes or diabetes, health care
providers conduct a Fasting Plasma Glucose Test (FPG) or an Oral Glucose Tolerance
Test (OGTT). Either test can be used to diagnose pre-diabetes or diabetes. The
American Diabetes Association recommends the FPG because it is easier, faster, and
less expensive to perform. With the FPG test, a fasting blood glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dl signals
pre-diabetes. A person with a fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg/dl or higher has
diabetes. In the OGTT test, a person's blood glucose level is measured after a fast and two hours
after drinking a glucose-rich beverage. If the two-hour blood glucose level is between
140 and 199 mg/dl, the person tested has pre-diabetes. If the two-hour blood glucose
level is at 200 mg/dl or higher, the person tested has diabetes.
What is diabetes?
Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by high blood sugar
(glucose) levels, which result from defects in insulin secretion, or action, or both. Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes (as it will be in this article) was
first identified as a disease associated with sweet urine," and excessive muscle loss in
the ancient world. Elevated levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia) lead to spillage of
glucose into the urine, hence the term sweet urine. Normally, blood glucose levels are
tightly controlled by insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin lowers the
blood glucose level. When the blood glucose elevates (for example, after eating food), insulin is released from the pancreas to normalize the glucose level. In patients with
diabetes, the absence or insufficient production of insulin causes hyperglycemia. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition, meaning that although it can be controlled, it
lasts a lifetime. What is the impact of diabetes?
Over time, diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney failure, and nerve damage. These
types of damage are the result of damage to small vessels, referred to as microvascular
disease. Diabetes is also an important factor in accelerating the hardening and
narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis), leading to strokes, coronary heart disease, and other large blood vessel diseases. This is referred to as macrovascular disease. Diabetes affects approximately 17 million people (about 8% of the population) in the
United States. In addition, an estimated additional 12 million people in the United States
have diabetes and don't even know it. From an economic perspective, the total annual
cost of diabetes in 1997 was estimated to be 98 billion dollars in the United States. The
per capita cost resulting from diabetes in 1997 amounted to $10,071.00; while
healthcare costs for people without diabetes incurred a per capita cost of $2,699.00. During this same year, 13.9 million days of hospital stay were attributed to diabetes, while 30.3 million physician office visits were diabetes related. Remember, these
numbers reflect only the population in the United States. Globally, the statistics are
staggering. What are the different types of diabetes?
There are two major types of diabetes, called type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes was
also called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), or juvenile onset diabetes
mellitus. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas undergoes an autoimmune attack by the body
itself, and is rendered incapable of making insulin. Abnormal antibodies have been
found in the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes. Antibodies are proteins in the
blood that are part of the body's immune system. The patient with type 1 diabetes must
rely on insulin medication for survival. In autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly
manufactures antibodies and inflammatory cells that are directed against and cause
damage to patients' own body tissues. In persons with type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of
69
the pancreas, which are responsible for insulin production, are attacked by the
misdirected immune system. It is believed that the tendency to develop abnormal
antibodies in type 1 diabetes is, in part, genetically inherited, though the details are not
fully understood. Exposure to certain viral infections (mumps and Coxsackie viruses) or
other environmental toxins may serve to trigger abnormal antibody responses that cause
damage to the pancreas cells where insulin is made. These antibodies can be measured
in the majority of patients, and may help determine which individuals are at risk for
developing type 1 diabetes. At present, the American Diabetes Association does not recommend general screening
of the population for type 1 diabetes, though screening of high risk individuals, such as
those with a first degree relative (sibling or parent) with type 1 diabetes should be
encouraged. Type 1 diabetes tends to occur in young, lean individuals, usually before 30
years of age, however, older patients do present with this form of diabetes on occasion. This subgroup is referred to as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). LADA is
a slow, progressive form of type 1 diabetes. Of all the patients with diabetes, only
approximately 10% of the patients have type 1 diabetes and the remaining 90% have
type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes was also referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus
(NIDDM), or adult onset diabetes mellitus (AODM). In type 2 diabetes, patients can
still produce insulin, but do so relatively inadequately for their body's needs, particularly in the face of insulin resistance as discussed above. In many cases this
actually means the pancreas produces larger than normal quantities of insulin. A major
feature of type 2 diabetes is a lack of sensitivity to insulin by the cells of the body
(particularly fat and muscle cells). In addition to the problems with an increase in
insulin resistance, the release of insulin by the pancreas may also be defective and
suboptimal. In fact, there is a known steady decline in beta cell production of insulin in
type 2 diabetes that contributes to worsening glucose control. (This is a major factor for
many patients with type 2 diabetes who ultimately require insulin therapy.) Finally, the
liver in these patients continues to produce glucose through a process called
gluconeogenesis despite elevated glucose levels. The control of gluconeogenesis
becomes compromised. While it is said that type 2 diabetes occurs mostly in individuals over 30 years old and
the incidence increases with age, we are seeing an alarming number patients with type 2
diabetes who are barely in their teen years. In fact, for the first time in the history of
humans, type 2 diabetes is now more common than type 1 diabetes in childhood. Most
of these cases are a direct result of poor eating habits, higher body weight, and lack of
exercise. While there is a strong genetic component to developing this form of diabetes, there are
other risk factors - the most significant of which is obesity. There is a direct relationship
between the degree of obesity and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and this holds
true in children as well as adults. It is estimated that the chance to develop diabetes
doubles for every 20% increase over desirable body weight. 70
Regarding age, data shows that for each decade after 40 years of age regardless of
weight there is an increase in incidence of diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes in
persons 65 to 74 years of age is nearly 20%. Type 2 diabetes is also more common in
certain ethnic groups. Compared with a 6% prevalence in Caucasians, the prevalence in
African Americans and Asian Americans is estimated to be 10%, in Hispanics 15%, and
in certain Native American communities 20% to 50%. Finally, diabetes occurs much
more frequently in women with a prior history of diabetes that develops during
pregnancy (gestational diabetes - see below). Diabetes can occur temporarily during pregnancy. Significant hormonal changes during
pregnancy can lead to blood sugar elevation in genetically predisposed individuals. Blood sugar elevation during pregnancy is called gestational diabetes. Gestational
diabetes usually resolves once the baby is born. However, 25-50% of women with
gestational diabetes will eventually develop Type 2 diabetes later in life, especially in
those who require insulin during pregnancy and those who remain overweight after their
delivery. Patients with gestational diabetes are usually asked to undergo an oral glucose
tolerance test about 6 weeks after giving birth to determine if their diabetes has persisted
beyond the pregnancy, or if any evidence (such as impaired glucose tolerance) is present
that may be a clue to the patient's future risk for developing diabetes. "Secondary" diabetes refers to elevated blood sugar levels from another medical
condition. Secondary diabetes may develop when the pancreatic tissue responsible for
the production of insulin is destroyed by disease, such as chronic pancreatitis
(inflammation of the pancreas by toxins like excessive alcohol), trauma, or surgical
removal of the pancreas. Diabetes can also result from other hormonal disturbances, such as excessive growth hormone production (acromegaly) and Cushing's syndrome. In
acromegaly, a pituitary gland tumor at the base of the brain causes excessive production
of growth hormone, leading to hyperglycemia. In Cushing's syndrome, the adrenal
glands produce an excess of cortisol, which promotes blood sugar elevation. In addition, certain medications may worsen diabetes control, or "unmask" latent
diabetes. This is seen most commonly when steroid medications (such as prednisone)
are taken and also with medications used in the treatment of HIV infection (AIDS). What are diabetes symptoms?
The early symptoms of untreated diabetes are related to elevated blood sugar levels, and
loss of glucose in the urine. High amounts of glucose in the urine can cause increased
urine output and lead to dehydration. Dehydration causes increased thirst and water
consumption. The inability of insulin to perform normally has effects on protein, fat and
carbohydrate metabolism. Insulin is an anabolic hormone, that is, one that encourages
storage of fat and protein. A relative or absolute insulin deficiency eventually leads to
weight loss despite an increase in appetite. Some untreated diabetes patients also
complain of fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Patients with diabetes are prone to
developing infections of the bladder, skin, and vaginal areas. Fluctuations in blood
71
glucose levels can lead to blurred vision. Extremely elevated glucose levels can lead to
lethargy and coma. How is diabetes diagnosed?
The fasting blood glucose (sugar) test is the preferred way to diagnose diabetes. It is
easy to perform and convenient. After the person has fasted overnight (at least 8 hours), a single sample of blood is drawn and sent to the laboratory for analysis. This can also
be done accurately in a doctor's office using a glucose meter. Normal fasting plasma glucose levels are less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Fasting plasma glucose levels of more than 126 mg/dl on two or more tests on different
days indicate diabetes. A random blood glucose test can also be used to diagnose
diabetes A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher indicates diabetes. When fasting blood glucose stays above 100mg/dl, but in the range of 100-126mg/dl, this is known as impaired fasting glucose (IFG). While patients with IFG do not have
the diagnosis of diabetes, this condition carries with it its own risks and concerns, and is
addressed elsewhere. The oral glucose tolerance test
Though not routinely used anymore, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a gold
standard for making the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It is still commonly used for
diagnosing gestational diabetes. With an oral glucose tolerance test, the person fasts
overnight (at least eight but not more than 16 hours). Then first, the fasting plasma
glucose is tested. After this test, the person receives 75 grams of glucose (100 grams for
pregnant women). There are several methods employed by obstetricians to do this test, but the one described here is standard. Usually, the glucose is in a sweet-tasting liquid
that the person drinks. Blood samples are taken at specific intervals to measure the
blood glucose. For the test to give reliable results, the person must be in good health (not have any
other illnesses, not even a cold). Also, the person should be normally active (not lying
down, for example, as an inpatient in a hospital) and should not be taking medicines that
could affect the blood glucose. For three days before the test, the person should have
eaten a diet high in carbohydrates (150- 200 grams per day). The morning of the test, the person should not smoke or drink coffee. The classic oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose levels five times over a
period of three hours. Some physicians simply get a baseline blood sample followed by
a sample two hours after drinking the glucose solution. In a person without diabetes, the
glucose levels rise and then fall quickly. In someone with diabetes, glucose levels rise
higher than normal and fail to come back down as fast. 72
People with glucose levels between normal and diabetic have impaired glucose
tolerance (IGT). People with impaired glucose tolerance do not have diabetes, but are at
high risk for progressing to diabetes. Each year, 1-5% of people whose test results show
impaired glucose tolerance actually eventually develop diabetes. Weight loss and
exercise may help people with impaired glucose tolerance return their glucose levels to
normal. In addition, some physicians advocate the use of medications, such as
metformin (Glucophage), to help prevent/delay the onset of overt diabetes. Recent
studies have shown that impaired glucose tolerance itself may be a risk factor for the
development of heart disease. In the medical community, most physicians are now
understanding that impaired glucose tolerance is nor simply a precursor of diabetes, but
is its own clinical disease entity that requires treatment and monitoring. Evaluating the results of the oral glucose tolerance test
Glucose tolerance tests may lead to one of the following diagnoses:  Normal response: A person is said to have a normal response when the 2-hour
glucose level is less than 140 mg/dl, and all values between 0 and 2 hours are
less than 200 mg/dl.  Impaired glucose tolerance: A person is said to have impaired glucose
tolerance when the fasting plasma glucose is less than 126 mg/dl and the 2-hour
glucose level is between 140 and 199 mg/dl.  Diabetes: A person has diabetes when two diagnostic tests done on different
days show that the blood glucose level is high.  Gestational diabetes: A woman has gestational diabetes when she has any two of the
following: a 100g OGTT, a fasting plasma glucose of more than 95 mg/dl, a 1-hour glucose
level of more than 180 mg/dl, a 2-hour glucose level of more than 155 mg/dl, or a 3-hour
glucose level of more than 140 mg/dl.

Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System
The nervous system is responsible for coordinating all the activity of the body. To
do this it first receives information from both external and internal sensory receptors
and then uses that information to adjust the activity of muscles and glands to match the
needs of the body. The nervous system can be subdivided into the central nervous system (CNS) and
the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord. Sensory information comes into the CNS, where it is processed. Motor messages then
exit the CNS carrying commands to muscles and glands. The PNS contains the cranial
nerves and spinal nerves. Sensory nerves carry information to the CNS and motor
nerves carry commands away from the CNS. All portions of the nervous system are
composed of nervous tissue. Nervous Tissue
Nervous tissue consists of two basic types of cells: neurons and neuroglial cells. Neurons are individual nerve cells. These are the cells that are capable of conducting
electrical impulses in response to a stimulus. Neurons have three basic parts: dendrites, a nerve cell body, and an axon. Dendrites are highly branched projections that receive
impulses. The nerve cell body contains the nucleus and many of the other organelles of
the cell. A neuron has only a single axon, a projection from the nerve cell body that
conducts the electrical impulse toward its destination. The point at which the axon of
one neuron meets the dendrite of the next neuron is called a synapse. Electrical
impulses cannot pass directly across the gap between two neurons, called the synaptic
cleft. They instead require the help of a chemical messenger, called a neurotransmitter.
Figure 11. 1 Neuron
A variety of neuroglial cells are found in nervous tissue. Each has a different
74
support function for the neurons. For example, some neuroglial cells produce myelin, a
fatty substance that acts as insulation for many axons. They do not conduct electrical
impulses. Central Nervous System
Because the central nervous system (CNS) is a combination of the brain and spinal
cord, it is able to receive impulses from all over the body, process this information, and
then respond with an action. This system consists of both gray and white matter. Gray
mater is comprised of unsheathed or uncovered cell bodies and dendrites. White matter
is myelinated nerve fibers. Bundles of nerve fibers interconnecting different parts of the
CNS are called tracts. The CNS is encased and protected by three membranes known as
the meninges. The Brain
The brain is one of the largest organs in the body and coordinates most body
activities. It is the center for all thought, memory, judgment, and emotion. Each part of
the brain is responsible for controlling different body functions, such as temperature
regulation and breathing. There are four sections to the brain: cerebrum, cerebellum, diencephalon, and brain stem.
Figure 11.2 The Brain
The largest section of the brain is the cerebrum. It is located in the upper portion of
the brain and is the area that processes thoughts, judgment, memory, association skills, and the ability to discriminate between items. The outer layer of the cerebrum is the
cerebral cortex, which is composed of folds of gray matter. The elevated portions of
the cerebrum, or convolutions, are called gyri and are separated by fissures, or valleys, called sulci. The cerebrum is subdivided into left and right haves called cerebral
hemispheres. Each hemisphere has four lobes. The lobes and their locations and
75
functions are as follows:
1. Frontal lobe: Most anterior portion of the cerebrum; controls motor function, personality, and speech. 2. Parietal lobe: The most superior portion of the cerebrum; receives and interprets
nerve impulses from sensory receptors and interprets language. 3. Occipital lobe: The most posterior portion of the cerebrum; controls vision. 4. Temporal lobe: The left and right lateral portion of the cerebrum; controls hearing
and smell.
Figure 11.3 Lobes of the Cerebrum
The diencephalon, located below the cerebrum, contains two of the most critical
areas of the brain, the thalamus and the hypothalamus. The thalamus is composed of
gray matter and acts as a center for relaying impulses from the eyes, ears, and skin to
the cerebrum. Our pain perception is controlled by the thalamus. The hypothalamus, lying just below the thalamus, controls body temperature, appetite, sleep, sexual desire, and emotions such as fear. The hypothalamus is actually responsible for controlling the
autonomic nervous system, cardiovascular system, the gastrointestinal system, and the
release of hormones from the pituitary gland. The cerebellum, the second largest portion of the brain, is located beneath the
posterior part of the cerebrum. This part of the brain aids in coordinating voluntary body
movements and maintaining balance and equilibrium. The cerebellum refines the
muscular movement that is initiated in the cerebrum. The final portion of the brain is the brain stem. This area has three components:
midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. The midbrain acts as a pathway for impulses
to be conducted between the brain and the spinal cord. The pons — a term that means
bridge — connects the cerebellum to the rest of the brain. The medulla oblongata is the
76
most inferior positioned portion of the brain; it connects the brain to the spinal cord. However, this vital area contains the centers that control respiration, heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure. Additionally this is the site where nerve tracts cross
from one side of the brain to control functions and movement on the other side of the
body.
Figure 11.4 Brain Stem
The brain has four interconnected cavities called ventricles: one in each cerebral
hemisphere, one in the thalamus, and one in front of the cerebellum. These contain
cerebrospinal fluid, which is the watery, clear fluid that provides protection from shock
or sudden motion to the brain. Spinal Cord
The function of the spinal cord is to provide a pathway for impulses traveling to
and from the brain. The spinal cord is actually a column of nervous tissue that extends
from the medulla oblongata of the brain down to the level of the second lumbar vertebra
within the vertebral column. The vertebral column consists of the 33 vertebrae of the
backbone. They line up to form a continuous canal for the spinal cord called the spinal
cavity or vertebral canal. Similar to the brain, the spinal cord is also protected by cerebrospinal fluid. The
inner core of the spinal cord contains gray matter. This inner core consists of cell
bodies and dendrites of peripheral nerves. The outer portion of the spinal cord is
myelinated white matter. The white matter is either ascending tracts carrying sensory
information up to the brain or descending tracts carrying motor commands down from
the brain to a peripheral nerve. Meninges
The meninges are three layers of connective tissue membranes that surround the
brain and spinal cord. Moving from external to internal, the meninges are
1. Dura mater: The name means tough mother; it forms a tough, fibrous sac around
77
78
the CNS. 2. Subdural space: The actual space between the dura mater and arachnoid layers. 3. Arachnoid layer: The name means spider-like, it is a thin, delicate layer attached to
the pia mater by web-like filaments. 4. Subarachnoid space: The space between the arachnoid layer and the pia mater; it
contains cerebrospinal fluid. 5. Pia mater: The name means soft mother; it is the innermost membrane layer and is
applied directly to the surface of the brain.
Figure 11.5 Meninges
Peripheral Nervous System
The peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes both the 12 pairs of cranial nerves
and the 31 pairs of spinal nerves. A nerve is a group or bundle of axon fibers located
outside the central nervous system that carries messages between the CNS and the
various parts of the body. Whether a nerve is cranial or spinal is determined by where
the nerve originates. Cranial nerves arise from the brain, mainly at the medulla
oblongata. Spinal nerves split off from the spinal cord, and one pair ( a left and a right )
exits between each pair of vertebrae. The point where either type of nerve is attached to
the CNS is called the nerve root. The names of most nerves reflect either the organ the
nerve serves or the portion of the body the nerve is traveling through. The entire list of
cranial nerves is found in Table 11.1. Figure 11.7 illustrates some of the major spinal
nerves in the human body. Table11.1 Cranial Nerves

Figure 11. 6 Cranial Nerves
Figure 11.7 Major spinal nerves
Although most nerves carry information to and from the CNS, individual neurons
carry information in only one direction. Afferent neurons, also called sensory neurons, carry sensory information from a sensory receptor to the CNS. Efferent neurons, also
called motor neurons, carry activity instructions from the CNS to muscles or glands out
in the body. The nerve cell bodies of the neurons forming the nerve are grouped together
in a knot-like mass, called a ganglion, located outside the CNS. The nerves of the PNS are subdivided into two divisions, the autonomic nervous
system and somatic nerves, each serving a different area of the body. Autonomic Nervous System
The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is involved with the control of involuntary or
unconscious bodily functions. It may increase or decrease the activity of the smooth
muscle found in viscera and blood vessels, the cardiac muscle of the heart, and glands. The ANS is divided into two branches: sympathetic branch and parasympathetic
branch. The sympathetic nerves stimulate the body in times of stress and crisis. These
nerves increase heart rate, dilate airways, increase blood pressure, inhibit digestion and
stimulate the production of adrenaline during a crisis. The parasympathetic nerves serve
as a counterbalance for the sympathetic nerves. Therefore, they cause heart rate to slow
down, lower blood pressure, and stimulate digestion. 80
81
Somatic Nerves
Somatic nerves serve the skin and skeletal muscles and are mainly involved with
the conscious and voluntary activities of the body. The large variety of sensory receptors
found in the dermis layer of the skin use somatic nerves to send their information, such
as touch, temperature, pressure, and pain, to the brain. These are also the nerves that
carry motor commands to skeletal muscles. Combining Forms Commonly Used in Nervous System

Diagnostic Procedures Relating to This System
Babinski’s reflex Reflex test developed by Joseph Babinski , a French
neurologist, to determine lesions and abnormalities
in the nervous system. The Babinski reflex is present
if the great toe extends instead of flexes when the
lateral sole of the foot is stroked. The normal
response to this stimulation is flexion of the toe. Brain scan Injection of radioactive isotopes into the circulation
to determine the function and abnormality of the
brain. Cerebral angiography X-ray of the blood vessels of the brain after the
injection of a radiopaque dye. Cerebralspinal fluid analysis Laboratory examination of the clear, watery, colorless fluid from within the brain and spinal cord. Infections and the abnormal presence of blood can
be detected in this test. Echoencephalography Recording of the ultrasonic echoes of the brain. Useful in determining abnormal patterns of shifting in
the brain. Electroencephalography Recording the electrical activity of the brain by
placing electrodes at various positions on the scalp. Also used in sleep studies to determine if there is a
normal pattern of activity during sleep. Electromyography(EMG) Recording of the contraction of muscles as a result of
receiving electrical stimulation. Lumbar puncture (LP) Puncture with a needle into the lumbar area (usually
the fourth intervertebral space) to withdraw fluid for
examination and for the injection of anesthesia. Also
called spinal puncture or spinal tap
Myelography Injection of a radiopaque dye into the spinal canal. An X-ray is then taken to examine the normal and
abnormal outlines made by the dye. Pneumoencephalography X-ray examination of the brain following withdrawal
of cerebrospinal fluid and injection of air or gas via
spinal puncture. Positron emission tomography Use of positive radionuclides to reconstruct brain
sections. Measurement can be taken of oxygen and
glucose uptake, cerebral blood flow, and blood
volume. The amount of glucose the brain uses
indicates how metabolically active the tissue is. Romberg’s test Text developed by Moritz Romberg, a German
physician, that is used to establish neurological
function; the person is asked to close his or her eyes
83
and place the feet together. This test for body balance
is positive if the patient sways when the eyes are
closed. Pathology Relating to the Nervous System
Concussion
Definition
Concussions range in severity from mild to severe, but they all share one common
factor — they temporarily interfere with the way your brain works. They can affect
memory, judgment, reflexes, speech, balance and coordination. Usually caused by a blow to the head, concussions don't always involve a loss of
consciousness. In fact, most people who have concussions never black out. Many
people have had concussions and not realized it. Concussions are common, particularly if you play a contact sport like football. But
every concussion, no matter how mild, injures your brain. This injury needs time and
rest to heal properly. Luckily, most concussions are mild and people usually recover
fully. Symptoms
The signs and symptoms of a concussion can be subtle and may not appear immediately. Symptoms can last for days, weeks or longer. The two most common concussion symptoms are confusion and amnesia. The amnesia, which may or may not be preceded by a loss of consciousness, almost always involves
the loss of memory of the impact that caused the concussion. Other immediate signs and symptoms of a concussion may include:  Headache
 Dizziness
 Ringing in the ears
 Nausea or vomiting
 Slurred speech
Some symptoms of concussions don't appear until hours or days later. They include:  Mood and cognitive disturbances
 Sensitivity to light and noise
 Sleep disturbances
84
Head trauma is very common in young children. But concussions can be difficult to
recognize in infants and toddlers because they can't readily communicate how they feel. Nonverbal clues of a concussion may include:  Listlessness, tiring easily
 Irritability, crankiness
 Change in eating or sleeping patterns
 Lack of interest in favorite toys
 Loss of balance, unsteady walking
Causes
Your brain has the consistency of gelatin. It's cushioned from everyday jolts and bumps
by the cerebrospinal fluid that it floats in, inside your skull. A violent blow to your head
can cause your brain to slide forcefully against the inner wall of your skull. Even the
sudden stop of a car crash can bounce your brain off the inside of your skull. This can
result in bleeding in or around your brain and the tearing of nerve fibers. Tests and diagnosis
Diagnosing a concussion is usually straightforward. If a blow to your head has knocked
you out or left you dazed, you've had a concussion. It's more difficult, however, to
determine whether the blow has caused potentially serious bleeding or swelling in your
skull. Signs and symptoms of these injuries may not appear until hours or days after the
injury. Your doctor may start your evaluation with questions about the accident, then proceed
to a neurological exam. This exam includes checking your memory and concentration, vision, hearing, balance, coordination and reflexes. The standard test to assess post-concussion damage is a computerized tomography (CT)
scan. A CT scanner takes multiple cross-sectional X-rays and combines all the resulting
images to produce detailed, two-dimensional images of your skull and brain. During the
procedure, you lie still on a table that slides through a large, doughnut-shaped X-ray
machine. The scan is painless and generally takes less than 10 minutes. Not every concussion requires a CT scan, but the test is usually done as a precaution if
there's a chance your injury is more severe than your immediate condition suggests. You're more likely to need a scan if you:  Are younger than 16 or older than 64
 Fell from a height of more than three feet  Had a motor vehicle accident  Are under the influence of alcohol or drugs
 Are unable to recall the accident for more than 30 minutes after it occurred
85
 Have persistent trouble with short-term memory — that is, retaining new
information — after you've completely regained consciousness
 Vomited
 Had a seizure
 Suffered bruises, scrapes or cuts on your head and neck
 Fractured your skull
You may need to be hospitalized overnight for observation after a concussion. If your
doctor says it's OK for you to be observed at home, someone should check on you
periodically for at least 24 hours. You may need to be awakened every two hours to
make sure you can be roused to normal consciousness. Howyoufeelpain
Jabbing, throbbing, burning or stinging — any way you describe pain, you want it
to stop. Finding out how your brain processes pain signals can help. Your experience of pain is part biology, but it's also influenced by psychological and
cultural factors. Despite years of research, questions linger about exactly what happens
between the moment you stub your toe and the moment you say "ouch" — or some
other choice word. How pain messages travel
Pain results from a series of exchanges among three major components of your nervous
system:  Your peripheral nerves. These nerves extend from your spinal cord to your
skin, muscles and internal organs. Some peripheral nerve fibers end with receptors
that respond to touch, pressure, vibration, cold and warmth. Other types of nerve
fibers end with nociceptors (no-sih-SEP-turs) — which are receptors that detect
actual or potential tissue damage. Nociceptors are most concentrated in areas prone to injury, such as your fingers
and toes. When nociceptors detect a harmful stimulus — such as the hard surface
that stubbed your toe — they relay pain messages in the form of electrical
impulses along a peripheral nerve to your spinal cord and brain. Sensations of
severe pain are transmitted almost instantaneously.  Your spinal cord. The nerve fibers that transmit pain messages — such as the
throbbing pain from that stubbed toe — enter the spinal cord in an area called the
dorsal horn. There, they release chemicals (neurotransmitters) that activate other
nerve cells in the spinal cord, which process the information and then transmit it
up to the brain.
86
 Your brain. When news of your stubbed toe travels up the spinal cord, it
arrives at the thalamus — a sorting and switching station deep inside your brain. The thalamus forwards the message simultaneously to three specialized regions of
the brain: the physical sensation region (somatosensory cortex), the emotional
feeling region (limbic system) and the thinking region (frontal cortex). Your brain
responds to pain by sending messages that moderate the pain in the spinal cord. The location of your pain can affect how you perceive it. A headache that interferes
with work or concentration may be more bothersome — and therefore receive a stronger
response — than arthritic pain in your knee or a cut to your finger. How you react to pain messages
Current understanding of pain is based on gate-control theory, which grew out of
observations of World War II veterans and their reactions to different types of injuries. The central concepts of gate-control theory are:  Pain messages don't travel directly from your pain receptors to your brain. When pain messages reach your spinal cord, they meet up with specialized nerve
cells that act as gatekeepers, which filter the pain messages on their way to your
brain. For severe pain that's linked to bodily harm, such as when you touch a hot
stove, the "gate" is wide open, and the messages take an express route to your
brain. Weak pain messages, however, may be filtered or blocked out by the gate. Nerve fibers that transmit touch also affect gatekeeper cells. This explains why
rubbing a sore area — such as the site of a stubbed toe — makes it feel better. The
signals of touch from the rubbing actually decrease the transmission of pain
signals.  Messages can change within your peripheral nerves and spinal cord. Nerve
cells in your spinal cord may release chemicals that intensify the pain, increasing
the strength of the pain signal that reaches your brain. This is called wind-up or
sensitization. At the same time, inflammation at the site of injury may add to your
pain.  Messages from your brain also affect the gate. Rather than just reacting to
pain, your brain actually sends messages that influence your perception of pain. Your brain may signal nerve cells to release natural painkillers, such as
endorphins (en-DOR-fins) or enkephalins (en-KEF-uh-lins), which diminish the
pain messages. This last idea explains how your brain — and its psychological and emotional processes — can affect your experience of pain. In fact, how you interpret pain messages and
tolerate pain can be affected by your:  Emotional and psychological state
87
 Memories of past pain experiences
 Upbringing
 Attitude
 Expectations
 Beliefs and values
 Age
 Sex
 Social and cultural influences
For example, a minor sensation that would barely register as pain, such as a dentist's
probe, can actually produce exaggerated pain for a child who's never been to the dentist
and who's heard horror stories about what it's like. But your emotional state can also work in your favor. Athletes can condition themselves
to endure pain that would incapacitate others. And, if you were raised in a home or
culture that taught you to "Grin and bear it" or to "Bite the bullet," you may experience
less discomfort than do people who focus on their pain or who are more prone to
complain. Word List

Discharge Summary
Admitting Diagnosis: Paraplegia following motorcycle accident
Final Diagnosis: Comminuted L2 fracture with epidural hematoma and spinal cord
damage resulting in complete paraplegia at the L2 level. History of Present Illness: Patient is a 23-year-old male who was involved in a
motorcycle accident. He was unconscious for 35 minutes but was fully aware of his
surroundings upon regaining consciousness. He was immediately aware of total
anesthesia and paralysis below the waist. Summary of Hospital Course: CT scan revealed extensive bone destruction at the
fracture site and the spinal cord was severed. Lumber puncture revealed sanguineous
cerebrospinal fluid. Patient was unable to voluntarily contract any lower extremity
muscles and was not able to feel touch or pinpricks. Lumbar laminectomy with spinal
fusion was performed to stabilize the fracture and remove the epidural hematoma. The
immediate postoperative recovery period proceeded normally with one incidence of
pneumonia due to extended bed rest. It responded to antibiotics and respiratory therapy
treatments. Patient began intensive rehabilitation with physical therapy and
occupational therapy to strengthen upper extremities, as well as transfer and ADL
training. After 2 months, X-rays indicated full healing of the spinal fusion and patient
92
was transferred to a rehabilitation institute. Discharge Plan: Patient was transferred to a rehabilitation institute to continue
intensive PT and OT. He will require skilled nursing care to evaluate his skin for the
development of decubitus ulcers and intermittent urinary catheterization for
incontinence. Since spinal cord was severed, it is not expected that this patient will
regain muscle function and sensation. However, long-term goals include independent
transfers, independent mobility with a wheelchair, and independent ADLs. Critical Thinking Questions

Blood and the Lymphatic
And Immune System
Part I: Blood
Anatomy and Physiology of Blood
The average adult has about 5 liters of blood. It circulates throughout the body
within the blood vessels of the cardiovascular system. Blood is a mixture of cells
floating in watery plasma. As a group these cells are referred to as formed elements, but there are three different kinds: erythrocytes or red blood cells, leukocytes or white
blood cells, and platelets. Blood cells are produced in the red bone marrow by a process
called hematopoiesis. Plasma and erythrocytes are responsible for transporting
substances, leukocytes protect the body from invading microorganism and platelets play
a role in controlling bleeding. Plasma
Liquid plasma composes about 55 percent of whole blood in the average adult and
90 to 92 percent is water. The remaining 8-10 percent portion of plasma is dissolved
substances, especially plasma proteins such as albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen. Albumin helps transport fatty substances that cannot dissolve in the watery plasma. There are three main types of globulins. One of these, gamma globulins, acts as
antibodies. Fibrinogen is a blood-clotting protein. In addition to the plasma proteins, smaller amounts of other important substances are also dissolved in the plasma for
transport: calcium, potassium, sodium, glucose, amino acids, fats, and waste products
such as urea and creatinine. Erythrocytes
Erythrocytes are also called red blood cells (RBCs). They are biconcave disks and
are enucleated, which means they no longer contain a nucleus. Red blood cells appear
red in color because they contain hemoglobin, which is an iron-containing pigment. Hemoglobin is the part of the red blood cell that picks up oxygen from the lungs and
delivers it to the tissues of the body. There are about 5 million erythrocytes per cubic millimeter of blood. The total
number in an average-sized adult is 35 trillion, with males having more red blood cells
than females. Erythrocytes have an average life span of 120 days and then the spleen
removes the worn-out and damaged ones from circulation. Much of the red blood cell, such as the iron, can be reused but one portion, bilirubin, is disposed of by the liver. 93
94
Leukocytes
Leukocytes, also referred to as white blood cells (WBCs), provide protection
against the invasion of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and other foreign material. In general, WBCs have a spherical shape with a large nucleus and there are about 8,000
per cubic millimeter of blood. There are five different types of WBCs, each with its own
strategy for protecting the body. The five can be subdivided into two categories:
granulocytes (with granules in the cytoplasm) and agranulocytes (without granules in
the cytoplasm). The name and function of each type is presented in Table 12.1. Table 12.1 Leukocyte Classification
Leukocyte Function
Granulocytes
Basophils Release histamine and heparin to damaged tissues
Eosinophils Destroy parasites and increase during allergic reactions
Neutrophils Important for phagocytosis: most numerous of the
leukocytes
Agranulocytes
Monocytes Important for phagocytosis
Lymphocytes Provide protection through an immunity activity
Platelets
Platelet is the modern term for thrombocyte. Platelets are the smallest of all the
formed blood elements. They are also not whole cells, but rather are formed when the
cytoplasm of a large precursor cell shatters into small plate-like fragments. There are
between 200,000 and 300,000 per cubic millimeter in the body. Platelets play a critical part in the blood-clotting process or hemostasis. They
agglutinate or clump together into small clusters when a blood vessel is cut or damaged. Platelets release a substance called thromboplastin, which, in the presence of calcium, reacts with prothrombin to form thrombin. Then thrombin, in turn, works to convert
fibrinogen to fibrin, which eventually becomes the mesh-like blood clot. See Figure

Blood Typing
Each person’s blood is different from others’ due to the presence of marker proteins on
the surface of his or her erythrocytes. Before a person receives a blood transfusion it is
important to do a blood typing. This is a laboratory test to determine if the donated blood is
compatible with the recipient’s blood. There are many different subgroups of blood markers, but the two most important ones are the ABO system and Rh factor. ABO System
In the ABO blood system there are two possible RBC markers, A and B. A person with an
A marker is said to have type A blood. Type A blood produces anti-B antibodies. The presence
of a B marker gives type B blood and anti-A antibodies. The absence of either an A or a B
marker results in type O blood, which contains both anti-A and anti-B antibodies. If both
markers are present, the blood is type AB and does not result in any antibodies. Because type O blood does not have either marker A or B, it will not react with anti-A or
anti-B antibodies. For this reason a person with type O blood is referred to as a universal
donor. In an emergency, type O blood may be given to a person with any of the other blood
types. Similarly, type AB blood is the universal recipient. A person with type AB blood has
no antibodies against the other blood types and, therefore, in an emergency, can receive any
type of blood. See Table 12. 3. Table 12.3 ABO System

Rh Factor
Rh factor is not as difficult to understand as the ABO system. A person with Rh factor on
his or her red blood cells is said to be Rh-positive (Rh+). Since this person has the factor, he
or she will not make anti-Rh antibodies. A person without the Rh factor is Rh-negative (Rh-)
and will produce anti-Rh antibodies. Therefore, an Rh+ person may receive both an Rh+ and
an Rh- transfusion, but an Rh- person can receive only Rh- blood. Part II: The Lymphatic and Immune System
97
Anatomy and Physiology
Of the Lymphatic and Immune System
The lymphatic and immune systems consist of a network of lymphatic vessels, lymph
nodes, spleen, thymus gland, and tonsils. This system performs several quite diverse
functions for the body. First, it collects excess tissue fluid throughout the body and returns it to
the circulatory system, purifying it as it passes through the system. Fluid within lymphatic
vessels is referred to as lymph. Lymph is composed of water, white blood cells, nutrients, hormones, salts carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2), and urea. Therefore, this system assists
the circulatory system in transporting substances throughout the body. Next, it serves as the
body’s primary defense system against the invasion of pathogens. Finally, lymph vessels
around the small intestines are able to pick up absorbed fats for transport. Lymphatic Vessels
The lymphatic vessels form an extensive network of vessels throughout the entire
body. However, unlike the circulatory system, these vessels are not a closed loop. Instead, they
serve as one-way pipes conducting lymph from the tissues toward the thoracic cavity. These
vessels begin as very small lymphatic capillaries in the tissues. Excessive tissue fluid enters
these capillaries to begin the trip back to the circulatory system. The capillaries merge into
large lymphatic vessels. These vessels have valves along their length to ensure that lymph can
only move forward toward the thoracic cavity. These vessels’ finally drain into one of two
large lymphatic ducts, the right lymphatic duct or the thoracic duct. The smaller right
lymphatic duct drains the right arm and the right side of the neck and chest. This duct empties
lymph into the right subclavian vein. The larger thoracic duct has the responsibility of draining
lymph from the rest of the body and emptying into the left subclavian vein. See figure 12.2. Lymph Nodes
Lymph nodes are small organs composed of lymphatic tissue located along the route of
the lymphatic vessels. These nodes, which are also referred to as lymph glands, have several
function, including the following:
1. Removing impurities from the lymph as it passes through
2. Manufacturing lymphocytes
3. Producing antibodies to fight disease
Once lymph is drained from the tissue, it is filtered in the node to remove impurities. Lymph nodes also serve to trap and destroy cells from cancerous tumors. Lymph nodes are
found throughout the body, but are particularly concentrated in several regions. For example, lymph nodes concentrated in the neck region drain lymph from the head. See Table 12. 4 for a
list of some of the most important sites for lymph nodes and Figure 12.3.
98
Figure 12.2 Lymphatic Vessels
Table 12.4 Sites for Lymph Nodes
Name Location Function
Axillary Armpits Become enlarged during infections of arms and
breast; cancer cells from breasts may be present
Cervical Neck Drains parts of head and neck; may be enlarged
during upper respiratory infections
Inguinal Groin Drains area of the legs and lower pelvis
Mediastinal Chest Assists in draining infection from within the chest
cavity
Figure 12.3 Lymph Nodes
Tonsils
The tonsils are collections of lymphatic tissue located on each side of the throat or
pharynx. There are three sets of tonsils: palatine tonsils; pharyngeal tonsils, commonly
referred to as the adenoids; and lingual tonsils. All tonsils contain a large number of
leukocytes and act as filters to protect the body from the invasion of pathogens through the
digestive or respiratory system. Tonsils are not required for life and can safely be removed if
they become a continuous site of infection. Spleen
The spleen, located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen, consists of lymphatic tissue
that is highly infiltrated with blood vessel. The vessels spread out into slow moving blood
sinuses. The spleen produces new red blood cells in the unborn baby. In adults it filters out
and destroys old red blood cells, recycling the iron, and also stores some of the blood supply
99
of the body. Phagocytic macrophages line the blood sinuses in the spleen to engulf and
remove pathogens. Because the blood is moving through the organ slowly, the macrophages
have time to carefully identify pathogens and worn-out RBCs. The spleen is not an essential
organ for life and can be removed due to injury or disease. However, without the spleen, a
person’s susceptibility to a blood stream infection may be increased. Thymus Gland
The thymus gland is located in the upper portion of the mediastinum. This gland is
essential for the proper development of the immune system. It assists the body with the
immune function and the development of antibodies. This organ’s hormone, thymosin, changes lymphocytes to T lymphocytes (simply called T cells). Theses cells play an important
role in the immune response. The thymus is active in the unborn child and throughout
childhood until adolescence, when it begins to shrink in size. Immunity
Immunity is the body’s ability to defend itself against pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoans, toxins, and cancerous tumors. Immunity comes in two forms: natural
immunity and acquired immunity. Natural immunity, also called innate immunity, is not
specific to a particular disease and does not require prior exposure to the pathogenic agent. A
good example of natural immunity is the macrophage. These leukocytes are present
throughout all the tissues of the body, but are concentrated in areas of high exposure to
invading bacteria, such as in the lungs and digestive system. They are very active phagocytic
cells, ingesting and digesting any pathogen they encounter. Acquired immunity is the body’s response to a specific pathogen. Acquired immunity may
be established either passively or actively. Passive acquired immunity results when a person
receives protective substances produced by another human or animal. This may take the form
of maternal antibodies crossing the placenta to a baby, or an antitoxin or gamma globulin
injection. Active acquired immunity develops following direct exposure to the pathogenic
agent. The agent stimulates the body’s immune response, a series of different mechanisms all
geared to neutralize the agent. Immunizations or vaccinations are special types of active
acquired immunity. Instead of actually being exposed to the infectious agent and having the
disease, a person is exposed to a modified or weakened pathogen that is still capable of
stimulating the immune response but not causing the disease. Immune response
Disease-causing agents are recognized as being foreign because they display proteins that
are different from a person’s own natural proteins. Those foreign proteins, called antigen, stimulate the immune response. The immune response consists of two distinct and different
processes: humoral immunity (also called antibody-mediated immunity) and cellular
immunity (also called cell-mediated immunity). Humoral immunity refers to the production of B lymphocytes, also called B cell. B cells
respond to antigens by producing a protective protein, an antibody. Antibodies combine with
the antigen to form an antigen-antibody complex. This complex either targets the foreign
substance for phagocytosis or prevents the infectious agent from damaging healthy cells. 100
101
Cellular immunity involves the production of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. These
defense cells are cytotoxic. They physically attack and destroy pathogenic cells. Standard Precautions
Hospital and other health care settings contain a large number of infective pathogens. Patients and health care workers are exposed to each other’s pathogens and sometimes become
infected. An infection acquired in this manner, as a result of hospital exposure, is referred to as
a nosocomial infection. Nosocomial infections can spread in several ways. Cross infection
occurs when a person, either a patient or health care worker, acquires a pathogen from another
patient or health care worker. Reinfection takes place when a person becomes infected again
with the same pathogen that originally brought him or her to the hospital. Self-inoculation
occurs when a person becomes infected in a different part of the body by a pathogen from
another part of his or her own body—such as intestinal bacteria spreading to the urethra. Combining Forms Commonly Used

And Lymphatic and Immune System
Iron Deficiency Anemia
Iron deficiency is defined as a decreased total iron body content. Iron deficiency anemia
occurs when iron deficiency is sufficiently severe to diminish erythropoiesis and cause the
development of anemia. Iron deficiency is the most prevalent single deficiency state on a
worldwide basis. It is important economically because it diminishes the capability of
individuals who are affected to perform physical labor, and it diminishes both growth and
learning in children. In healthy people, the body concentration of iron (approximately 60 parts per million [ppm]) is
regulated carefully by absorptive cells in the proximal small intestine, which alter iron
absorption to match body losses of iron. Persistent errors in iron balance lead to either iron
deficiency anemia or hemosiderosis. Both are disorders with potential adverse consequences. Iron is vital for all living organisms because it is essential for multiple metabolic processes, including oxygen transport, DNA synthesis, and electron transport. Iron equilibrium in the
body is regulated carefully to ensure that sufficient iron is absorbed in order to compensate for
body losses of iron.
While body loss of iron quantitatively is as important as absorption in terms of maintaining
iron equilibrium, it is a more passive process than absorption. Consistent errors in maintaining
this equilibrium lead to either iron deficiency or iron overload. Iron balance is achieved largely by regulation of iron absorption in the proximal small
intestine. Either diminished absorbable dietary iron or excessive loss of body iron can cause
iron deficiency. Diminished absorption usually is due to an insufficient intake of dietary iron
in an absorbable form. Hemorrhage is the most common cause of excessive loss of body iron, but it can occur with
hemoglobinuria from intravascular hemolysis. Malabsorption of iron is relatively uncommon
in the absence of small bowel disease (sprue, celiac disease, regional enteritis) or previous
gastrointestinal surgery. Iron uptake in the proximal small bowel occurs by 3 separate pathways. These are the heme
pathway and separate pathways for ferric and ferrous iron. In North America and Europe, one third of dietary iron is heme iron, but two thirds of body
iron is derived from dietary myoglobin and hemoglobin. Heme iron is not chelated and
precipitated by numerous constituents of the diet that renders nonheme iron nonabsorbable . Examples are phytates, phosphates, tannates, oxalates, and carbonates. Heme is maintained
soluble and available for absorption by globin degradation products produced by pancreatic
enzymes. Heme iron and nonheme iron are absorbed into the enterocyte noncompetitively. Heme enters the cell as an intact metalloporphyrin, presumably by a vesicular mechanism. Heme is degraded within the enterocyte by heme oxygenase with release of iron so that it
traverses the basolateral cell membrane in competition with nonheme iron to bind transferrin
in the plasma. Ferric iron utilizes a different pathway to enter cells than ferrous iron. This was shown by
competitive inhibition studies, the use of blocking antibodies against divalent metal
transporter-1 (DMT-1) and beta3-integrin, and transfection experiments using DMT-1 DNA. This indicated that ferric iron utilizes beta3-integrin and mobilferrin, while ferrous iron uses
DMT-1 to enter cells. Which pathway transports most nonheme iron in humans is not known. Most nonheme dietary
iron is ferric iron. Iron absorption in mice and rats may involve more ferrous iron because they
excrete moderate quantities of ascorbate in intestinal secretions. Contrariwise, humans are a
scorbutic species and are unable to synthesize ascorbate to reduce ferric iron. Other proteins are described that appear related to iron absorption. These are stimulators of
iron transport (SFT), which are reported to increase the absorption of both ferric and ferrous
iron, and hephaestin, which is postulated to be important in the transfer of iron from
enterocytes into the plasma. The relationship and interactions between the newly described
proteins is not known at this time and is being explored in a number of laboratories. 104
105
The iron concentration within enterocytes varies directly with the body's requirement for iron. Absorptive cells in iron-deficient humans and animals contain little stainable iron, whereas
this is increased significantly in subjects who are replete in iron. Untreated phenotypic
hemochromatosis creates little stainable iron in the enterocyte, similar to iron deficiency. Iron
within the enterocyte may operate by up-regulation of a receptor, saturation of an iron-binding
protein, or both. In contrast to findings in iron deficiency, enhanced erythropoiesis, or hypoxia, endotoxin rapidly diminishes iron absorption without altering enterocyte iron concentration. This suggests that endotoxin and, perhaps, cytokines alter iron absorption by a different
mechanism. Most iron delivered to nonintestinal cells is bound to transferrin. Transferrin iron is delivered
into nonintestinal cells via 2 pathways, the classical transferrin receptor pathway (high affinity, low capacity) and the pathway independent of the transferrin receptor (low affinity, high
capacity). Otherwise, the nonsaturability of transferrin binding to cells cannot be explained. In the classical transferrin pathway, the transferrin iron complex enters the cell within an
endosome. Acidification of the endosome releases the iron from transferrin so that it can enter
the cell. The apotransferrin is delivered by the endosome to the plasma for reutilization. The
method by which the transferrin receptor–independent pathway delivers iron to the cell is not
known. Nonintestinal cells also possess the mobilferrin integrin and DMT-1 pathways. Their function
in the absence of an iron-saturated transferrin is uncertain; however, their presence in
nonintestinal cells suggests they may participate in intracellular functions in addition to their
capability to facilitate cellular uptake of iron. Word List

Discharge Summary
Admitting Diagnosis: Splenomegaly, weight loss, diarrhea, fatigue, chronic cough
Final Diagnosis: Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, primary site spleen; splenectomy. History of Present Illness: Patient is a 36-year-old business man who was first seen in the
office with complaints of feeling generally “run down,” intermittent diarrhea, weight loss, and, more recently, a dry cough. He states he has been aware of these symptoms for approximately
6 months, but admits it may have been “coming on” for closer to 1 year. A screening test for
mononucleosis was negative. A chest X-ray was negative for pneumonia or bronchitis, but did
reveal suspicious nodules in the left thoracic cavity. In spite of a 35-pound weight loss, he has
abdominal swelling and splenomegaly detected with abdominal palpation. He was admitted to
the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Summary of Hospital Course: Blood tests were negative for the Epstein-Barr virus and
hepatitis B. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed generalized splenomegaly and located a 3-cm
encapsulated tumor. A lymphangiogram identified the thoracic nodules to be enlarged lymph
glands. Biopsies taken from the spleen tumor and thoracic lymph glands confirmed the
diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. A full body MRI failed to demonstrate any additional
metastases in the liver or brain. The patient underwent splenectomy for removal of the primary
tumor. Discharge Plan: Patient was discharged home following recovery from the splenectomy. The
abdominal swelling and diarrhea were resolved, but the dry cough persisted. He was referred
to an oncologist for evaluation and establishment of a chemotherapy and radiation therapy
protocol to treat the metastatic thoracic lympadenomas and ongoing surveillance for additional
metastases. Critical Thinking Questions
1. What complaints caused the patient to go to the doctor?
2. Explain in your own words what negative, as in “chest X-ray was negative for pneumonia,” means. 3. This discharge summary contains four medical terms that have not been introduced yet. Describe each of these terms in your own word. Use your text as a dictionary. a. primary site
b. encapsulated
c. ascites
d. metastases
4. What is the name of a diagnostic procedure that produces an image from high-frequency
sound waves? The procedure is _____________. 5. Which of the following pathological conditions was discovered using this procedure?
a. inflammatory liver disease
b. an acute infection with a large number of lymphocytes
c. a malignant tumor of the thymus gland
d. an enlarged spleen
6. What diagnostic test failed to find any cancer in other organs of the body? Which organs
are free of cancer?
7. When the patient was discharged from the hospital, which symptoms were resolved and
which persisted?
Resolved:
Persisted:
Answers
1. feeling “run down”, intermittent diarrhea, weight loss, dry cough
